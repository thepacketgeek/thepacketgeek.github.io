#### Running Scapy

Scapy can be run in two different modes, interactively from a terminal window and programmatically from a Python script. Let&#8217;s start getting familiar with Scapy using the interactive mode.

Scapy comes with a short script to start interactive mode so from your terminal you can just type `scapy`:

<pre class="lang:default decode:true ">localhost:~ packetgeek$ scapy

#### <!--more-->Basic Scapy Commands

To see a list of what commands Scapy has available, run the `lsc()` function:

<pre class="lang:default decode:true ">&gt;&gt;&gt; lsc()
arping              : Send ARP who-has requests to determine which hosts are up
bind_layers         : Bind 2 layers on some specific fields' values
fuzz                : Transform a layer into a fuzzy layer by replacing some default values by random objects
ls                  : List  available layers, or infos on a given layer
promiscping         : Send ARP who-has requests to determine which hosts are in promiscuous mode
rdpcap              : Read a pcap file and return a packet list
send                : Send packets at layer 3
sendp               : Send packets at layer 2
sniff               : Sniff packets
split_layers        : Split 2 layers previously bound
sr                  : Send and receive packets at layer 3
sr1                 : Send packets at layer 3 and return only the first answer
srflood             : Flood and receive packets at layer 3
srloop              : Send a packet at layer 3 in loop and print the answer each time
srp                 : Send and receive packets at layer 2
srp1                : Send and receive packets at layer 2 and return only the first answer
srpflood            : Flood and receive packets at layer 2
srploop             : Send a packet at layer 2 in loop and print the answer each time
traceroute          : Instant TCP traceroute
tshark              : Sniff packets and print them calling pkt.show(), a bit like text wireshark
wireshark           : Run wireshark on a list of packets
wrpcap              : Write a list of packets to a pcap file
&gt;&gt;&gt;</pre>

<p class="caption">
  Note: I truncated this list to show the commands we will be discussing in this guide.
</p>

Wow, what a great list of commands! I&#8217;ll at least introduce most of these commands, and there are a few that we&#8217;ll use extensively. For the next few topics, we&#8217;ll specifically be covering: `ls()`, `send()`, `sniff()`, and `sr*()`.

In fact, let&#8217;s go ahead and use one of those now to show off some of the amazing built in capabilities of Scapy! I&#8217;m going to sniff a single packet real quick and then we&#8217;ll play around with that.

<pre class="lang:default decode:true ">&gt;&gt;&gt; pkt = sniff(count=1)
&gt;&gt;&gt; type(pkt)
scapy.plist.PacketList
&gt;&gt;&gt; pkt

&gt;&gt;&gt; pkt[0].summary()
'Ether / IP / ICMP 172.16.20.10 &gt; 4.2.2.1 echo-request 0 / Raw'
&gt;&gt;&gt;</pre>

So, what I&#8217;ve done here is defined a `pkt` variable that is equal to whatever `sniff()` returns. In this case, that will be a single packet since I&#8217;ve passed in the `count` argument with a value of 1. Our `pkt` now holds an array containing single packet. If we increased `count` to a value of 2 or greater, then `sniff()` will return an array of all those packets. I&#8217;ll show you how to access each packet individually a little bit later.

But wait, how does Scapy know that this packet contains Ethernet, IP and ICMP layers!? I&#8217;m glad you asked, Scapy has a wide range of built in protocol support. The list is much to long for me to print out here, so I&#8217;ll let you run this next command on your own.

The `explore()`&nbsp;function provides a GUI for viewing and selecting protocol layers:

<pre class="lang:default decode:true  ">Packets contained in scapy.layers.dns:

Or directly explore a specific layer (without the GUI selector):

<pre class="lang:default decode:true">&gt;&gt;&gt; explore(scapy.layers.dhcp)
Packets contained in scapy.layers.dhcp:
Class|Name
-----|------------
BOOTP|BOOTP
DHCP |DHCP options</pre>

You can also use the `ls()`&nbsp;command to view the available protocols and fields for each layer. In Scapy Interactive mode, run the `ls()` command and just look at ALL the supported protocols.

<pre class="lang:default decode:true">&gt;&gt;&gt; ls()
ARP        : ARP
ASN1_Packet : None
BOOTP      : BOOTP
...</pre>

As you can see, Scapy has a huge range of supported protocols. We&#8217;ll only work with a handful of those in the upcoming topics but feel free to dig into them more for your own network tools. To see the fields and default values for any protocol, just run the `ls()` function on the protocol like this:

<pre class="lang:default decode:true">&gt;&gt;&gt; ls(Ether)
dst        : DestMACField         = (None)
src        : SourceMACField       = (None)
type       : XShortEnumField      = (0)</pre>

<pre class="lang:default decode:true ">&gt;&gt;&gt; ls(IP)
version    : BitField             = (4)
ihl        : BitField             = (None)
tos        : XByteField           = (0)
len        : ShortField           = (None)
id         : ShortField           = (1)
flags      : FlagsField           = (0)
frag       : BitField             = (0)
ttl        : ByteField            = (64)
proto      : ByteEnumField        = (0)
chksum     : XShortField          = (None)
src        : Emph                 = (None)
dst        : Emph                 = ('127.0.0.1')
options    : PacketListField      = ([])</pre>

<pre class="lang:default decode:true ">&gt;&gt;&gt; ls(UDP)
sport      : ShortEnumField       = (53)
dport      : ShortEnumField       = (53)
len        : ShortField           = (None)
chksum     : XShortField          = (None)</pre>

Now that we have a better idea of the Scapy commands and protocol support, let&#8217;s dig into some packets.
