#### Using Scapy in a Python Script

So far we&#8217;ve been working with Scapy in interactive mode. It&#8217;s very powerful but there are times when it would be easier to work with a Python script instead. In order to use Scapy, we have to import the Scapy module like this:

    from scapy.all import *

This will import all Scapy functions, but if you know that you will only need a few of the functions, you can import them individually as well like this:

    from scapy.all import sr1,IP,ICMP

<!--more-->The biggest different with running Scapy in a script is that the output may not be as verbose as interactive mode. If you&#8217;re not getting all the output you need, make sure to try using the 

`print` command. Here&#8217;s an example with our previous ping example:

<pre class="lang:default decode:true ">#! /usr/bin/env python3

from scapy.all import ICMP, sr1

print(sr1(IP(dst="4.2.2.1")/ICMP()).summary())

============================Console Output:===========================
Begin emission:
..Finished to send 1 packets.
.*
Received 4 packets, got 1 answers, remaining 0 packets
IP / ICMP 4.2.2.1 &gt; 172.16.20.40 echo-reply 0 / Padding
</pre>

&nbsp;

#### Using Scapy to monitor ARP traffic

Let&#8217;s pretend that there is concern about someone potentially trying to use an ARP poisoning attack on our network. Using Scapy, we want to write a script that will listen to packets and print out all ARP requests and responses. We can do that very simply using the Scapy `sniff()` function and the `filter` argument like this:

<pre class="lang:default decode:true">#! /usr/bin/env python3

from scapy.all import sniff

pkts = sniff(filter="arp", count=10)
print(pkts.summary())

============================Console Output:===========================
Ether / ARP who has 172.16.20.10 says 172.16.20.40 / Padding
Ether / ARP who has 172.16.20.92 says 172.16.20.2 / Padding
Ether / ARP who has 172.16.20.2 says 172.16.20.92 / Padding
Ether / ARP who has 172.16.20.203 says 172.16.20.200 / Padding
Ether / ARP is at 00:11:22:29:a6:85 says 172.16.20.203
Ether / ARP who has 172.16.20.2 says 172.16.20.103 / Padding
Ether / ARP who has 172.16.20.103 says 172.16.20.2 / Padding
Ether / ARP who has 172.16.20.150 says 172.16.20.15 / Padding
Ether / ARP who has 172.16.20.2 says 172.16.20.19 / Padding
Ether / ARP who has 172.16.20.19 says 172.16.20.2 / Padding</pre>

&nbsp;

This is a very simple script that gives us some good visibility to what&#8217;s happening with ARP on our network. But what if we wanted to customize the output a little bit? Maybe we can get it in a format that would be easy to write to a file or send to some type of external monitoring server.

#### Using the prn Argument to Customize sniff() Output

I&#8217;m going to introduce the `prn` argument and show you how to do change what Scapy prints out for each packet:

<pre class="lang:default decode:true ">#! /usr/bin/env python3

from scapy.all import ARP, sniff

def arp_display(pkt):
    if pkt[ARP].op == 1:  # who-has (request)
        return f"Request: {pkt[ARP].psrc} is asking about {pkt[ARP].pdst}"
    if pkt[ARP].op == 2:  # is-at (response)
        return f"*Response: {pkt[ARP].hwsrc} has address {pkt[ARP].psrc}"

sniff(prn=arp_display, filter="arp", store=0, count=10)


============================Console Output:===========================
Request: 172.16.20.168 is asking about 172.16.20.85
Request: 172.16.20.168 is asking about 172.16.20.229
Request: 172.16.20.2 is asking about 172.16.20.203
*Response: aa:bb:cc:29:a6:85 has address 172.16.20.203
Request: 172.16.20.200 is asking about 172.16.20.82
Request: 172.16.20.51 is asking about 172.16.20.254
Request: 172.16.20.15 is asking about 172.16.20.58
Request: 172.16.20.15 is asking about 172.16.20.58
Request: 172.16.20.200 is asking about 172.16.20.44
*Response: dd:ee:ff:a2:02:bf has address 172.16.20.44</pre>

Basically, what the `prn` argument lets us do is replace the default Scapy printout of the packet summary and run our own function to determine how Scapy prints out. That&#8217;s really cool! It works by passing the packet object to the defined function, in this case `arp_display()`, each time a packet is sniffed that matches the specified filter.

We can do a lot more with that `prn` argument and passing more than just the packet object to the custom defined function using nested functions. That&#8217;s outside the scope of this guide but feel free to read about it here: [Scapy Sniffing with Custom Actions](http://thepacketgeek.com/scapy-sniffing-with-custom-actions-part-2/ "Scapy Sniffing with Custom Actions")
