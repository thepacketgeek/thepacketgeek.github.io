For those of you Cisco IOS ninjas that can differentiate the `show ip route` table codes in your sleep, the first several lines of this command output are just a nuisance. Here&#8217;s a quick way to remove that unnecessary text from the output so you can get straight to finding out where your traffic is headed.Â And all with just a few additional keystrokes to the end of the command:

`# show ip route | e -`

<!--more-->Cleans up this table&#8230;

    R6#sh ip route
    Codes: L - local, C - connected, S - static, R - RIP, M - mobile, B - BGP
           D - EIGRP, EX - EIGRP external, O - OSPF, IA - OSPF inter area 
           N1 - OSPF NSSA external type 1, N2 - OSPF NSSA external type 2
           E1 - OSPF external type 1, E2 - OSPF external type 2
           i - IS-IS, su - IS-IS summary, L1 - IS-IS level-1, L2 - IS-IS level-2
           ia - IS-IS inter area, * - candidate default, U - per-user static route
           o - ODR, P - periodic downloaded static route, + - replicated route
    
    Gateway of last resort is not set
    
          3.0.0.0/32 is subnetted, 1 subnets
    D        3.3.3.3 [90/156160] via 10.1.36.3, 00:07:32, FastEthernet0/1
          4.0.0.0/32 is subnetted, 1 subnets
    D        4.4.4.4 [90/158720] via 10.1.36.3, 00:07:22, FastEthernet0/1
          5.0.0.0/32 is subnetted, 1 subnets
    D        5.5.5.5 [90/161280] via 10.1.36.3, 00:07:22, FastEthernet0/1
          6.0.0.0/32 is subnetted, 1 subnets
    C        6.6.6.6 is directly connected, Loopback0
          10.0.0.0/8 is variably subnetted, 4 subnets, 2 masks
    D        10.1.34.0/24 [90/30720] via 10.1.36.3, 00:07:32, FastEthernet0/1
    C        10.1.36.0/24 is directly connected, FastEthernet0/1
    L        10.1.36.6/32 is directly connected, FastEthernet0/1
    D        10.1.45.0/24 [90/33280] via 10.1.36.3, 00:07:22, FastEthernet0/1

&#8230;so it looks like this:

    R6#sh ip route | e -
    
    Gateway of last resort is not set
    
          3.0.0.0/32 is subnetted, 1 subnets
    D        3.3.3.3 [90/156160] via 10.1.36.3, 00:07:32, FastEthernet0/1
          4.0.0.0/32 is subnetted, 1 subnets
    D        4.4.4.4 [90/158720] via 10.1.36.3, 00:07:22, FastEthernet0/1
          5.0.0.0/32 is subnetted, 1 subnets
    D        5.5.5.5 [90/161280] via 10.1.36.3, 00:07:22, FastEthernet0/1
          6.0.0.0/32 is subnetted, 1 subnets
    C        6.6.6.6 is directly connected, Loopback0
          10.0.0.0/8 is variably subnetted, 4 subnets, 2 masks
    D        10.1.34.0/24 [90/30720] via 10.1.36.3, 00:07:32, FastEthernet0/1
    C        10.1.36.0/24 is directly connected, FastEthernet0/1
    L        10.1.36.6/32 is directly connected, FastEthernet0/1
    D        10.1.45.0/24 [90/33280] via 10.1.36.3, 00:07:22, FastEthernet0/1

Much cleaner, right?!?

Also, this works when you&#8217;re printing out RIBs for multiple VRFs. In just a small MPLS VPN lab the routes can quickly get out of hand, but see how much nicer this is to look through:

    R6#show ip route vrf * | e -
