This post quickly covers the tools I'm using after about 2 months of development study and practice. I will revisit this in a year or so to se what has changed and explain what tools I still use, and what tools end up getting replaced. My workflow seems to be very generic right now and it will be interesting to see how it changes as I mature as a developer.

**<!--more-->Code editing**

<a title="VSCode" href="http://www.sublimetext.com" target="_blank">Sublime Text</a> (well duh!) - Typically with the folder of the project I'm working on, whether that be a website or git repo. The multiple cursors, built-in code completion, and endless plugins make this choice a no brainer!

**Source versioning**

****Git - I use 3 different git frontends depending on the location of the remote repo. CLI for my website hosting, <a title="GitHub Mac App" href="http://mac.github.com" target="_blank">GitHub app</a> for GitHub, and <a title="SourceTree" href="http://www.sourcetreeapp.com/" target="_blank">SourceTree</a> for BitBucket and other local repos.

**Snippets**

<a title="Gist" href="https://gist.github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub Gists</a> - I access this via the Gist plugin in Sublime Text which is extremely easy to use. I originally tried out CodeBox but it just was weird going to another app to grab some code, even with the easy to use menubar access.

**Code testing**

Chrome - I use this for my main browser and also for testing web stuff I'm working on. The Dev Tools are amazing and I love the speed.

<a title="CodeRunner" href="http://krillapps.com/coderunner/" target="_blank">CodeRunner</a> - From the Mac App Store, this app is amazing for running snippets of any type of code. I use it mostly for Python right now, as my work with Javascript and PHP is testing usually in the browser.

<a title="Node.js" href="http://nodejs.org/" target="_blank">Node.js</a> - For running Javascript apps locally, this is an awesome framework. I love how easy it is to use <a title="NPM" href="http://npmjs.org" target="_blank">NPM</a> for package management with package.json.

**Image editing**

<a title="Pixelmator" href="http://www.pixelmator.com" target="_blank">Pixelmator</a>Â - I can't believe the amount of features you get for such a low price! Â I used to have access to Photoshop at school and it took a bit of adjustment to Pixelmator, but I'm easily capable to doing 95% of what I knew how to do in Photoshop. That last 5% wasn't too important anyway ðŸ™‚

**Misc**

<a title="Evernote" href="http://www.evernote.com" target="_blank">Evernote</a> - I keep articles, notes, documentation, comics, and screenshots in Evernote.Â I've been using Evernote since it was in beta andÂ I still find new ways to use it and I love that. It's the app that grows with you.

<a title="1Password" href="https://agilebits.com/onepassword" target="_blank">1Password</a> - I needed a quick way to generate random passwords and keep track of my million different logins, 1Password provided that in ways I couldn't imagine.

<a title="Spotify" href="http://www.spotify.com" target="_blank">Spotify</a> - I need tunes. Like, all the time. For the cost of an album a month I can listen to whatever I want.

<a title="iTerm 2" href="http://www.iterm2.com" target="_blank">iTerm2</a>Â - Custom Triggers & Profiles, playback, enough said
