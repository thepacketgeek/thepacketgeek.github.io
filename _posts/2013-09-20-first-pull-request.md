I submitted my first GitHub Pull Request today so I figured that this development thing is doable and I might as well write some articles about my coding exploration!

What I&#8217;m feeling right now is an overwhelming of all the fantastic resources out there, it&#8217;s just impossible to absorb info as quick as I find it. I&#8217;m finding that the people in the developer community are just as nice as those I&#8217;ve reached out to in the networking world. We really just want to get some bits from point A to point B, right?!?
