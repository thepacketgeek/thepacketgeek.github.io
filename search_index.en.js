that you're familiar with the basics of setting up a peer with ExaBGP and advertising routes, let's look at expanding those concepts towards something that might actually be used in production.\nPeering with Multiple BGP Routers\n\n\nNetworks running BGP tend to have more than one edge router that you would want to advertise routes to with ExaBGP, so first let's look at how to setup our conf.ini file to add peers. What I didn't mention in the previous articles is that the&nbsp;group { } object in the config file is similar to a peer-group in Cisco IOS. The difference is that you can only have one group per ExaBGP instance, but this makes sense since the use case seems to be advertising and receiving updates to/from one ASN. We can setup shared values such as router-id, our local AS and update source, and the peer AS. Then we activate each neighbor within the group:\ngroup AS_65000 {\n        router-id 172.16.2.1;\n        local-as 65001;\n        local-address 172.16.2.1;\n        peer-as 65000;\n\n        neighbor 172.16.2.10 {\n        }\n\n        neighbor 172.16.2.20 {\n        }\n\n        process flask-api {\n                run /path/to/python /path/to/app.py;\n        }\n}\n\nAnd here's the basic BGP config on our routers:\nCRS1#sh run | s bgp\nrouter bgp 65000\n neighbor 172.16.2.1 remote-as 65001\n neighbor 172.16.2.1 description ExaBGP\n neighbor 172.16.2.1 soft-reconfiguration inbound\n neighbor 172.16.2.20 remote-as 65000\n neighbor 172.16.2.20 soft-reconfiguration inbound\n\nCSR2#sh run | s bgp\nrouter bgp 65000\n neighbor 172.16.2.1 remote-as 65001\n neighbor 172.16.2.1 description ExaBGP\n neighbor 172.16.2.1 soft-reconfiguration inbound\n neighbor 172.16.2.10 remote-as 65000\n neighbor 172.16.2.10 soft-reconfiguration inbound\n\nAdvertising Routes to Multiple Peers\nWith each router being peered with ExaBGP, you can use the same announce|withdraw route x.x.x.x/x next-hop y[.y.y.y] command and the UPDATE message will be sent to all peers. But what if you want to send the same prefix with different next-hops to your routers? Well, this type of advertisement granularity is definitely possible. Let's imagine this scenario where we want to send the 100.100.0.0/16 prefix to both CSR routers, but each router should use a different outbound next-hop.\n\nThe commands to do this (possibly using curl with the Flask based HTTP API from the previous article) are:\nneighbor 172.16.2.10 announce route 100.100.0.0/16 next-hop 172.16.2.201\nneighbor 172.16.2.20 announce route 100.100.0.0/16 next-hop 172.16.2.202\n\nAnd the results on our routers are below. Note that because of the iBGP peering between the routers, both have each other's next hop advertisements in the BGP table. Only the advertised prefix from the ExaBGP is installed in the RIB because of the preference for eBGP learned routes however.\nCRS1#sh bgp | b Network\n     Network          Next Hop            Metric LocPrf Weight Path\n * i 100.100.0.0/16   172.16.2.202             0    100      0 65001 i\n *&gt;                   172.16.2.201                           0 65001 i\nCRS1#sh ip route bgp | b subnet\n      100.0.0.0/16 is subnetted, 1 subnets\nB        100.100.0.0 [20/0] via 172.16.2.201, 00:01:40\n\nCSR2#sh bgp | b Network\n     Network          Next Hop            Metric LocPrf Weight Path\n *&gt;  100.100.0.0/16   172.16.2.202                           0 65001 i\n * i                  172.16.2.201             0    100      0 65001 i\nCSR2#sh ip route bgp | b subnet\n      100.0.0.0/16 is subnetted, 1 subnets\nB        100.100.0.0 [20/0] via 172.16.2.202, 00:03:15\n\nAdvertising Prefixes with Attributes\nIn all of these examples so far, I've been setting the next-hop attribute to either an IP address or the self keyword. Using the next-hop self will act as expected and advertise the next-hop as the IP address of the ExaBGP machine. The good news is, we can change other attributes as well! I'm not sure if this is an exhaustive list as it's not well documented (that I can find, maybe this will be my mission) but I dug through the code and test examples to extract the following list and examples of values that we can use:\n\nMED (Multi Exit Discriminator): med 50\nOrigin: origin incomplete (also egb or igp)\nLocal Preference: local-preference 200\nAS Path: as-path [ 65000 65010 65020 ]\nCommunity: community [65000:2]\n\nPlease note local-preference will only work if ExaBGP and the peer you're advertising to are in the same AS (iBGP), since local-preference is non-transitive and will not be advertised outside the ExaBGP AS.\nFrom what I see, you can combine these as you wish. Here's a few example commands I ran into ExaBGP and the output on one of my routers (I used the Flask HTTP API created in the previous article as a simple way to inject these into the ExaBGP process):\nannounce route 100.10.0.0/16 next-hop 172.16.2.202 med 500\nannounce route 100.20.0.0/16 next-hop 172.16.2.202 origin incomplete as-path [100 200 400]\nannounce route 100.30.0.0/16 next-hop 172.16.2.202 med 200 origin egp\nannounce route 100.40.0.0/16 next-hop 172.16.2.202 community [65000:2]\n\nCRS1#sh bgp | b Network\n     Network          Next Hop            Metric LocPrf Weight Path\n * i 100.10.0.0/16    172.16.2.202           500    100      0 65001 i\n *&gt;                   172.16.2.202           500             0 65001 i\n * i 100.20.0.0/16    172.16.2.202             0    100      0 65001 100 200 400 ?\n *&gt;                   172.16.2.202                           0 65001 100 200 400 ?\n * i 100.30.0.0/16    172.16.2.202           200    100      0 65001 e\n *&gt;                   172.16.2.202           200             0 65001 e\n * i 100.40.0.0/16    172.16.2.202                           0 65001 i\n *&gt;                   172.16.2.202                           0 65001 i\nCRS1#\nCRS1#sh ip bgp 100.40.0.0\nBGP routing table entry for 100.40.0.0/16, version 3\nPaths: (2 available, best #2, table Default-IP-Routing-Table)\n  Advertised to update-groups:\n     1\n  65001\n    172.16.2.202 from 172.16.2.1 (172.16.2.1)\n      Origin IGP, localpref 100, valid, external\n      Community: 6553700\n  Local\n    172.16.2.202 (metric 20) from 172.16.2.20 (2.2.2.2)\n      Origin IGP, metric 11, localpref 100, valid, internal, best\n\nAdvertising Multiple Prefixes with the same Attributes\nThere is a shortcut&nbsp;when advertising multiple prefixes that have the same attributes (next-hop, med, origin, etc.). It works very similar to BGP UPDATE messages where you set all the desired attributes, and then list the prefixes that share these attributes. Based on notes from the ExaBGP docs, this is an unsupported feature but I like it and hope that more focus can be brought to make this production ready.\nHere's two example commands, note that we can specify a neighbor or send to all neighbors, just like the&nbsp;other examples listed so far:\nannounce attribute next-hop self med 50 origin igp nlri 100.10.0.0/16 100.20.0.0/16\nneighbor 172.16.2.20 announce attribute next-hop self med 150 origin incomplete nlri 100.30.0.0/16 100.40.0.0/16\n\n\nThat turned out to be a pretty jam-packed with excitement post! There's some helpful flexibility built into ExaBGP and we haven't even gotten to the exciting part.&nbsp;The next couple posts will start to use ExaBGPs JSON interface to receive and work with advertised routes from the peered routers, instead of focusing on pushing advertisements out to your routers.\n","id":"https://thepacketgeek.com/exabgp/advanced-route-announcement/","title":"Advanced Route Announcement"},"https://thepacketgeek.com/exabgp/automate-exabgp/":{"body":"If you haven't read the intro post to this series, Getting Started with ExaBGP, check that article out first as this post will be expanding on the previous example to show how to use python for more automated interaction with ExaBGP.\n\nThe first example I'll cover is using a basic health check test to determine if a route should be announced or withdrawn from BGP. Here is our python script healthcheck.py with comments inline:\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\n\nimport socket\nfrom sys import stdout\nfrom time import sleep\n\n\ndef is_alive(address, port):\n    \"\"\" This is a function that will test TCP connectivity of a given\n    address and port. If a domain name is passed in instead of an address,\n    the socket.connect() method will resolve.\n \n    address (str): An IP address or FQDN of a host\n    port (int): TCP destination port to use\n \n    returns (bool): True if alive, False if not\n    \"\"\"\n \n    # Create a socket object to connect with\n    s = socket.socket()\n    \n    # Now try connecting, passing in a tuple with address &amp; port\n    try:\n        s.connect((address, port))\n        return True\n    except socket.error:\n        return False\n    finally:\n        s.close()\n\nwhile True:\n    if is_alive('thepacketgeek.com', 80):\n        stdout.write('announce route 100.10.10.0/24 next-hop self' + '\\n')\n        stdout.flush()\n    else:\n        stdout.write('withdraw route 100.10.10.0/24 next-hop self' + '\\n')\n        stdout.flush()\n    sleep(10)\n\nLet's update our ExaBGP's conf.ini to run this python script:\nprocess healthcheck {\n    run /path/to/python3 /path/to/healthcheck.py;\n    encoder json;\n}\n\nneighbor 172.16.2.10 {\n    router-id 172.16.2.1;\n    local-address 172.16.2.1;\n    local-as 65000;\n    peer-as 65000;\n\n    api {\n        processes [healthcheck];\n    }\n}\n\nNow when we run ExaBGP with $ exabgp conf.ini, the health check python script will also run and push either 'announce' or 'withdraw' commands depending on the service availability. It doesn't matter that we're sending BGP UPDATE messages with the same route over and over again, but we may want to increase the delay if it's causing high CPU on the device. Here's what we see in the ExaBGP output about every 10 seconds:\n... | INFO | 1095 | processes | Command from process healthcheck : announce route 100.10.10.0/24 next-hop self\n... | INFO | 1095 | reactor | Route added to neighbor 172.16.2.128 local-ip 172.16.2.1 local-as 65000 peer-as 65000 router-id 172.16.2.1 family-allowed in-open : 100.10.10.0/24 next-hop 172.16.2.1\n... | INFO | 1095 | reactor | Performing dynamic route update\n... | INFO | 1095 | reactor | Updated peers dynamic routes successfully\n\nVery cool, right? Ok, but now what if we block/kill the TCP check?\n... | INFO     | 1095   | processes     | Command from process healthcheck : withdraw route 100.10.10.0/24 next-hop self\n... | INFO     | 1095   | reactor       | Route removed : 100.10.10.0/24 next-hop 172.16.2.1\n... | INFO     | 1095   | reactor       | Performing dynamic route update\n... | INFO     | 1095   | reactor       | Updated peers dynamic routes successfully\n\nBoom, routes removed. That's fantastic. What if we want to check multiple end hosts and automate different prefix advertisements? Well, that could entail an entire application to manage and monitor the end host and prefix objects, but here's a quick and dirty modification of our healthcheck.py script:\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\n\nimport socket\nfrom collections import namedtuple\nfrom sys import stdout\nfrom time import sleep\n\n \ndef is_alive(address, port):\n    \"\"\" same as above, removed for brevity \"\"\"\n\n# Add namedtuple object for easy reference below\nTrackedObject = namedtuple('EndHost', ['address','port','prefix', 'nexthop'])\n\n\n# Make a list of these tracked objects\ntracked_objects = [\n    TrackedObject('thepacketgeek.com', 80, '100.10.10.0/24', 'self'),\n    TrackedObject('8.8.8.8', 53, '200.20.20.0/24', 'self'),\n]\n\n\nwhile True:\n    for host in tracked_objects:\n        if is_alive(host.address, host.port):\n            stdout.write('announce route {} next-hop {}\\n'.format(host.prefix, host.nexthop))\n            stdout.flush()\n        else:\n            stdout.write('withdraw route {} next-hop {}\\n'.format(host.prefix, host.nexthop))\n            stdout.flush()\n    sleep(10)\n\nWe can create a list of tracked objects to iterate through every 10 seconds or so (depending on timeouts and availability of the services we're checking). Just picture the flexibility possible if we were to read from a database for each tracked object and do some real threading to get the timing of the checks more precise.\nThe next post in this series will expand on the automation of ExaBGP using python by providing an API to control routes from an external system.\n","id":"https://thepacketgeek.com/exabgp/automate-exabgp/","title":"Using service health checks to automate ExaBGP"},"https://thepacketgeek.com/exabgp/control-bgp-advertisements/":{"body":"We know that ExaBGP can be used to inject BGP routes into an AS that you control. It's a very helpful feature that allows you to automate reachability and traffic flows within your network. But what if you want to you ExaBGP to influence what is advertised, or in this case, not advertised to external peers that are not willing to peer with your ExaBGP service?\n\n\nOur scenario is this: We have a 100.10.10.0/24 prefix attached to our SW. The&nbsp;CE router&nbsp;learns about this prefix from SW&nbsp;via OSPF, and then advertises the prefix out to the Internet via the&nbsp;PE router. This&nbsp;100.10.10.0/24 prefix is anycasted so it is also advertised out of a different location. In order to withdraw the prefix from the PE and therefore&nbsp;the Internet we would need to manually filter the&nbsp;prefix outbound via route-map, or stop the advertisement from the SW which would also remove the resource from local resources.\nThere has to be a better way, right? You're in luck because I'm going to show you how we can use ExaBGP and BGP communities along with some basic functionality on your existing routers to indirectly influence the advertisement of the 100.10.10.0/24 prefix.\nHere's how our BGP peer configuration looks on the CE router:\nCE# show run\nrouter bgp 65000\n network 100.10.10.0 mask 255.255.255.0\n network 100.10.20.0 mask 255.255.255.0\n neighbor 172.16.2.1 remote-as 100\n neighbor 172.16.2.1 route-map OUTBOUND out\n neighbor 10.0.0.3 remote-as 65000\n neighbor 10.0.0.3 weight 32768\n!\nip community-list standard EXABGP permit 6553700\n!\nroute-map OUTBOUND deny 10\n match community EXABGP\n!\nroute-map OUTBOUND permit 20\n\nHere's the important details:\n\nPeering with PE&nbsp;(172.16.2.1) goes through route-map OUTBOUND \n\nThis route-mapmatchesthecommunity-listEXABGP to match community 6553700 (or [100:100]) \n\nAny prefix with this community is dropped, all other prefixes are allowed\n\n\n\n\nPeeringwithExaBGP (10.0.0.3) \n\nSetting the weight of learned routes from ExaBGP to 32768 ties with the default local sourced weight\nBy matching&nbsp;the Cisco-proprietary weight value, the higher local-preference will win out even on non-Cisco BGP routers\nThis must be an iBGP peering (same AS) so that local-preference passed with the UPDATE from ExaBGP\n\n\n\nHere's what the network looks like before the ExaBGP announcement :\nC##sh ip bgp | b Network\n   Network          Next Hop            Metric LocPrf Weight Path\n*&gt; 100.10.20.0/24   0.0.0.0                  0         32768 i\n*&gt; 100.10.10.0/24   10.0.0.2                11         32768 i\n\n\nPE#sh ip bgp | b Network\n   Network          Next Hop            Metric LocPrf Weight Path\n*&gt; 100.10.20.0/24   172.16.2.2               0             0 65000 i\n*&gt; 100.10.10.0/24   172.16.2.2              11             0 65000 i\n\nAnd here is what it looks like after:\nCE#sh ip bgp | b Network\n   Network          Next Hop            Metric LocPrf Weight Path\n*&gt; 100.10.20.0/24   0.0.0.0                  0         32768 i\nr&gt;i100.10.10.0/24   172.16.2.2                  65000  32768 i\nr                   10.0.0.2                11         32768 i\nCE#sh ip bgp nei 172.16.2.2 adv | b Network\n   Network          Next Hop            Metric LocPrf Weight Path\n*&gt; 100.10.20.0/24   0.0.0.0                  0         32768 i\n\nTotal number of prefixes 1\n\n\nPE#sh ip bgp | b Network\n   Network          Next Hop            Metric LocPrf Weight Path\n*&gt; 100.10.20.0/24   172.16.2.2               0             0 65000 i\n\nCE knows about the 100.10.10.0/24 prefix and uses SW as its next-hop. PE is learning the prefix from CE with next-hop of CE&nbsp;due to the eBGP peering. &nbsp;Notice that the default weight for locally sourced (network or redistribute commands) prefixes on R1 is 32768. This weight value can range from 0-65535, and on a Cisco device, it is the first value taken into account during the BGP Path Selection algorithm.\nWhen we startup ExaBGP and advertise the prefix 100.10.10.0/24, CE&nbsp;changes the prefix's weight to 65000 and it takes preference over the locally sourced route (network 100.10.10.0 mask 255.255.255.0) and is marked as best. Now when CE&nbsp;calculates which prefixes to advertise out to PE, it selects the 100.10.10.0/24 prefix&nbsp;from ExaBGP, which happens to be marked with the [100:100] community. This prefix is then filtered in the outbound advertisements with the OUTBOUND route-map and Viola! The prefix is no longer advertised to PE and the rest of the Internet from this site. The r code (RIB failure) on the routes in lines 4 and 5 is happening&nbsp;because the R1 can't prefer the BGP route and install it in the RIB since the OSPF learned prefix has a lower AD. 100.10.10.0/24 is still reachable from R1 and AR so it's not a big deal, read more about it from ipspace.net.\nHere's the ExaBGP conf.ini and python script that allows for this magic to happen:\nfrom sys import stdout, stdin\nfrom time import sleep\n\n# Print the command to STDIN so ExaBGP can execute\nstdout.write('announce route 100.10.10.0/24 next-hop 10.0.0.2 local-preference 65000 community [100:100]\\n')\nstdout.flush()\n\n#Keep the script running so ExaBGP doesn't stop running and tear down the BGP peering\nwhile True:\n    sleep(10)&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;pre class=\"lang:ini decode:true\" title=\"conf.ini\"&gt;group test {\n    router-id 10.0.0.3;\n    local-as 65000;\n    local-address 10.0.0.3;\n\n    process add_route {\n        run /usr/bin/python /etc/exabgp/add_route.py;\n    }\n\n    neighbor 10.0.0.1 {\n        peer-as 65000;\n    }\n}\n\nNote that this python script clearly isn't the only way to get ExaBGP to advertise this route to R1. The focus of this post is more of how to use the ExaBGP announcements to manipulate your traffic flows by managing prefix advertisements. To see more examples of how to control ExaBGP, check out the earlier posts in this series.\n","id":"https://thepacketgeek.com/exabgp/control-bgp-advertisements/","title":"Control BGP Advertisements"},"https://thepacketgeek.com/exabgp/getting-started/":{"body":"I'm really excited about these next few posts. I've been doing some research on BGP and automating routing decisions with python, which led to my discovery of ExaBGP. ExaBGP is dubbed \"The BGP swiss army knife\", and I'm early in my experimentation with this tool, but it seems to be a very easy way to peer with your BGP routers and control the advertisement of networks.\n\nThis post will cover basic setup of ExaBGP and peering with a router, as well as how you can tie in python to present control for the advertisement of routes. The next post will use the Flask web framework to offer a simple HTTP API for adding/removing routes. I hope the following posts will be along the lines of receiving the BGP UPDATE messages from peered routers to monitor and analyze advertised networks.\nStep 1: Install ExaBGP\nThe installation is very simple, you just install via pip in your global python packages, or preferably in a virtualenv (or similar) to not interfere with your other projects:\n$ pip3 install exabgp\n\nThis should work on OS X and *nix, but I did have some problems trying to run ExaBGP on Windows.\nStep 2: Configure your Router\nI'm using a Cisco CSR-1000V virtual router instance on the same machine I'm running python/ExaBGP on, but you can also use any router that has IP connectivity to the machine you are running ExaBGP with. Note that my CSR-1000V router has the IP address of 172.16.2.128/24, and my ExaBGP machine has an IP address of 172.16.2.1/24. Here's my router's very basic BGP config and local IP addresses.\nCRS1#sh run | s i bgp\nrouter bgp 65000\n  bgp log-neighbor-changes\n  network 10.10.0.0 mask 255.255.255.0\n  neighbor 172.16.2.1 remote-as 65000\n  neighbor 172.16.2.1 update-source GigabitEthernet1\nCRS1#sh ip int bri\nInterface              IP-Address      OK? Method Status                Protocol\nGigabitEthernet1       172.16.2.128   YES NVRAM  up                    up\nLoopback0              1.1.1.1         YES NVRAM  up                    up\nLoopback10             10.10.0.1       YES NVRAM  up                    up\n\nIf you run a show bgp summary command, you will see the neighbor in BGP Idle state since our ExaBGP side hasn't tried peering yet. I also recommend using debug bgp all (only in a lab of course) to monitor the connection status and updates from ExaBGP:\nCRS1#show bgp summary | i 172.16.2.1\n172.16.2.1      4        65000       0       0        1    0    0 00:01:53 Idle\nCRS1#debug bgp all\nBGP debugging is on for all address families\n\nStep 3: Configure ExaBGP\nNow we can configure ExaBGP to peer with our router using a conf.ini file. Explanations for each directive are commented inline:\nneighbor 172.16.2.128 {                 # Remote neighbor to peer with\n    router-id 172.16.2.1;              # Our local router-id\n    local-address 172.16.2.1;          # Our local update-source\n    local-as 65000;                    # Our local AS\n    peer-as 65000;                     # Peer's AS\n}\n\nIf we start ExaBGP now, we'll see the neighbors peer successfully and the ExaBGP process will receive BGP UPDATE messages for any prefixes the CSR router is currently advertising. Here's what we see when starting ExaBGP:\n(exabgp)packetgeek:exabgp mat$ exabgp ./conf.ini\n....(configuration load info truncated)\n17:01:37 | 27403  | welcome       | Thank you for using ExaBGP\n17:01:37 | 27403  | version       | 4.0.2\n17:01:37 | 27403  | configuration | performing reload of exabgp 4.0.2-1c737d99\n17:01:37 | 27403  | reactor       | loaded new configuration successfully\n17:01:37 | 27403  | reactor       | connected to peer-1 with outgoing-1 172.16.2.1-172.16.2.128\n\nAnd running show bgp summary on the router also confirms that the peering is in an Established state:\nCRS1#show bgp summary | i Neighbor|172.16.2.1\nNeighbor        V           AS MsgRcvd MsgSent   TblVer  InQ OutQ Up/Down  State/PfxRcd\n172.16.2.1      4        65000       6       8       23    0    0 00:03:31        0\n\nWell, that's certainly a start!\nStep 4: Write python Script to add/remove Routes\nUsing an example from ExaBGP, we're going to create&nbsp;a very simple python script named example.py to advertise two prefixes to our CSR router:\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\n\nfrom __future__ import print_function\n\nfrom sys import stdout\nfrom time import sleep\n\nmessages = [\n    'announce route 100.10.0.0/24 next-hop self',\n    'announce route 200.20.0.0/24 next-hop self',\n]\n\nsleep(5)\n\n#Iterate through messages\nfor message in messages:\n    stdout.write(message + '\\n')\n    stdout.flush()\n    sleep(1)\n\n#Loop endlessly to allow ExaBGP to continue running\nwhile True:\n    sleep(1)\n\n\nThe reason this script works is that ExaBGP monitors STDOUT while running and parses for commands such as \"announce route …\" and \"withdraw route …\". Check out this&nbsp;full list of API commands, I'll be covering several of these in the upcoming articles. Now we just need to update our conf.ini file to run this python script upon startup of ExaBGP:\nprocess announce-routes {\n    run /path/to/python3 /path/to/example.py;\n    encoder json;\n}\n\nneighbor 172.16.2.128 {                 # Remote neighbor to peer with\n    router-id 172.16.2.1;              # Our local router-id\n    local-address 172.16.2.1;          # Our local update-source\n    local-as 65000;                    # Our local AS\n    peer-as 65000;                     # Peer's AS\n\n    api {\n        processes [announce-routes];\n    }\n}\n\nHere's the output from exabgp:\n(exabgp)packetgeek:exabgp mat$ exabgp ./conf.ini\n....(configuration load info truncated)\n17:11:52 | 27396  | welcome       | Thank you for using ExaBGP\n17:11:52 | 27396  | version       | 4.0.2\n17:11:52 | 27396  | configuration | performing reload of exabgp 4.0.2-1c737d99\n17:11:52 | 27396  | reactor       | loaded new configuration successfully\n17:11:52 | 27396  | reactor       | connected to peer-1 with outgoing-1 172.16.2.1-172.16.2.128\n17:11:57 | 27396  | api           | route added to neighbor 172.16.2.128 local-ip 172.16.2.1 local-as 65000 peer-as 65000 router-id 172.16.2.1 family-allowed in-open : 100.10.0.0/24 next-hop self\n17:11:58 | 27396  | api           | route added to neighbor 172.16.2.128 local-ip 172.16.2.1 local-as 65000 peer-as 65000 router-id 172.16.2.1 family-allowed in-open : 200.20.0.0/24 next-hop self\n\nAnd after this finishes, we can confirm the new prefixes on our router by running show bgp:\nCRS1#sh bgp | b Network\n     Network          Next Hop            Metric LocPrf Weight Path\n *&gt;  10.10.0.0/24     0.0.0.0                  0         32768 i\n *&gt;i 100.10.0.0/24    172.16.2.1                    100      0 i\n *&gt;i 200.20.0.0       172.16.2.1                    100      0 i\n\nCongrats! We just used python to inject routes into the BGP and RIB tables on a router. I know this example is a little boring since you have to preconfigure the prefixes and use sleep timers, but I'll cover how to make this a little more interactive in the next post.\n","id":"https://thepacketgeek.com/exabgp/getting-started/","title":"ExaBGP and Python"},"https://thepacketgeek.com/exabgp/http-api/":{"body":"We've covered how to setup ExaBGP and peer with a router, and then how to use python to add &nbsp;and remove advertised routes in BGP either with static definitions or dynamically through health checking. There may be some of you out there with some sort of application that is already monitoring routes and you're trying to figure out how to connect it with ExaBGP for the actual interaction part? Well, what if we add an HTTP API to ExaBGP to give programmatic access to ExaBGP from some external utility? I'll go over two ways to do this using the Python built-in SimpleHTTPServer or Flask.\nUsing SimpleHTTPServer\nThis option is great since you don't need to install any extra modules. It seems to be pretty lightweight and should be enough for some basic HTTP interaction with ExaBGP. The basic functions that we need this API to do are receive a form via HTTP POST and print that to STDOUT. Since ExaBGP is executing the python script, the STDOUT output will be visible to the ExaBGP process. After the ExaBGP command is printed, we'll return the command to the browser as confirmation that the call was successful. Here's the example:\nimport cgi\nimport SimpleHTTPServer\nimport SocketServer\nfrom sys import stdout\n\nPORT = 5001\n\nclass ServerHandler(SimpleHTTPServer.SimpleHTTPRequestHandler):\n\n    def createResponse(self, command):\n        \"\"\" Send command string back as confirmation \"\"\"\n        self.send_response(200)\n        self.send_header('Content-Type', 'application/text')\n        self.end_headers()\n        self.wfile.write(command)\n        self.wfile.close()\n\n    def do_POST(self):\n        \"\"\" Process command from POST and output to STDOUT \"\"\"\n        form = cgi.FieldStorage(\n            fp=self.rfile,\n            headers=self.headers,\n            environ={'REQUEST_METHOD':'POST'})\n        command = form.getvalue('command')\n        stdout.write('%s\\n' % command)\n        stdout.flush()\n        self.createResponse('Success: %s' % command)\n\nhandler = ServerHandler\nhttpd = SocketServer.TCPServer(('', PORT), handler)\nstdout.write('serving at port %s\\n' % PORT)\nstdout.flush()\nhttpd.serve_forever()\n\nUsing Flask\nIf you have bigger plans for the HTTP side of things and want to work with a web framework like Flask, this example is for you. The biggest difference is that you will have to install Flask&nbsp;and its dependencies, although that's easy:\n$ pip install flask\nNow we'll create a Flask http_api.py file to listen for prefix commands via HTTP POST&nbsp;calls and print them to STDOUT so ExaBGP can do its magic:\nfrom flask import Flask, request\nfrom sys import stdout\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\n\n# Setup a command route to listen for prefix advertisements \n@app.route('/', methods=['POST'])\ndef command():\n\n\tcommand = request.form['command']\n\tstdout.write('%s\\n' % command)\n\tstdout.flush()\n\n\treturn '%s\\n' % command\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    app.run()\n\nBefore you run off and put this on your production systems I have a couple&nbsp;disclaimers:\n\nThis script uses the built-in Flask debug HTTP server. It's fine for lab use, but I would use gunicorn and nginx for real heavy lifting.\nThe script doesn't do any validation of the command. A better script would make sure it's a valid command and prefix.\nFlask defaults to listening on the localhost address on TCP port 5000. You can change this though and I highly recommend reading Flask's Quickstart to familiarize yourself with the many options.\n\nHooking the HTTP API up to the ExaBGP process\nUpdate the conf.ini file to run this script instead of our previous health check example:\ngroup test {                         # An arbitrary group name\n    router-id 172.16.2.1;            # Our local router-id\n    \n    neighbor 172.16.2.128 {          # Remote neighbor to peer with\n        local-address 172.16.2.1;    # Our local update-source\n        local-as 65000;              # Our local AS\n        peer-as 65000;               # Peer's AS\n    }\n \n    process http-api {\n        run \\path\\to\\python \\path\\to\\http_api.py;\n    }\n}\n\nAnd now when we run $ exabgp conf.ini, you'll see the confirmation&nbsp;of running the python script&nbsp;at the end of the output, along with the debug output of both Flask or SimpleHTTPServer:\n... | INFO     | 20432  | reactor       | New peer setup: neighbor 172.16.2.128 local-ip 172.16.2.1 local-as 65000 peer-as 65000 router-id 172.16.2.1 family-allowed in-open\n... | WARNING  | 20432  | configuration | Loaded new configuration successfully\n... | INFO     | 20432  | processes     | Forked process http-api\n * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)\n\nOnce either HTTP&nbsp;service is running (somewhat wrapped by the ExaBGP process), we can make HTTP POST calls via command line (curl, wget) or via a GUI HTTP tool (Postman). I'll show a quick example of both:\nCurl:\npacketgeek:~ mat$ curl --form \"command=announce route 100.10.0.0/24 next-hop self\" http://localhost:5000/ \nannounce route 100.10.0.0/24 next-hop self\n\nPostman:\n~\nWhen we run show bgp on the router, we can see our advertised network:\nCRS1#sh bgp | b Network\n     Network          Next Hop            Metric LocPrf Weight Path\n *&gt;  10.10.0.0/24     0.0.0.0                  0         32768 i\n *&gt;i 100.10.0.0/24    172.16.2.1                    100      0 i\n\nSo, there's a real quick and dirty way to allow external calls to ExaBGP for your RIB manipulation. The next post will cover more advanced peering and advertising options with ExaBGP.\n","id":"https://thepacketgeek.com/exabgp/http-api/","title":"Give ExaBGP an HTTP API"},"https://thepacketgeek.com/exabgp/storing-in-mongo-db/":{"body":"Now that you know how to advertise prefixes to BGP peers with ExaBGP and are familiar with how to use this to influence traffic in your network, let's change gears and look at processing BGP messages between ExaBGP and its peers. Since ExaBGP uses JSON for message data, I figured it would be a good opportunity to use MongoDB&nbsp;so&nbsp;the message information can easily be stored into a database for data collection and analysis.\n\n\nIn the ExaBGP configuration file you can specify the types of messages you want to receive on STDOUT and also the encoding of the messages (text or JSON). Here's an example of configuring ExaBGP to send all BGP messages to the script running in the process section:\ngroup test { \n    router-id 172.16.2.1; \n    local-as 65000; \n    local-address 172.16.2.1; \n\n    process syslog { \n        run /usr/bin/python path/to/syslog.py; \n        encoder json;\n        receive {\n            parsed;\n            update;\n            neighbor-changes;\n        }\n    } \n\n    neighbor 172.16.2.10 { \n        peer-as 65000; \n    }\n}\n\nThis should look real similar to previous ExaBGP config files, but note the new receive section and encoder directive under process syslog. This tells ExaBGP to output&nbsp;neighbor changes, updates, and all other parsed BGP messages in JSON format to STDOUT. There is also an option to output messages that ExaBGP sends to peers which you can read about here, but is outside the scope of this post.\nNow that ExaBGP is outputting these messages we'll look&nbsp;at how to use the python script specified in the process syslog section to parse the data.&nbsp;Here's an example of the messages in JSON format we receive when ExaBGP peers with a router, receives a prefix, and then the peering is shutdown:\n// ExaBGP connects with peer 172.16.2.10\n{\n  \"exabgp\": \"3.4.8\",\n  \"time\": 1435450105,\n  \"host\": \"packetgeek.local\",\n  \"pid\": \"93361\",\n  \"ppid\": \"92918\",\n  \"counter\": 14,\n  \"type\": \"state\",\n  \"neighbor\": {\n    \"ip\": \"172.16.2.10\",\n    \"address\": {\n      \"local\": \"172.16.2.1\",\n      \"peer\": \"172.16.2.10\"\n    },\n    \"asn\": {\n      \"local\": \"65000\",\n      \"peer\": \"65000\"\n    },\n    \"state\": \"up\"\n  }\n}\n\n// UPDATE message sent from peer with attributes and accompanying prefix(es)\n{\n  \"exabgp\": \"3.4.8\",\n  \"time\": 1435450105,\n  \"host\": \"packetgeek.local\",\n  \"pid\": \"93361\",\n  \"ppid\": \"92918\",\n  \"counter\": 15,\n  \"type\": \"update\",\n  \"neighbor\": {\n    \"ip\": \"172.16.2.10\",\n    \"address\": {\n      \"local\": \"172.16.2.1\",\n      \"peer\": \"172.16.2.10\"\n    },\n    \"asn\": {\n      \"local\": \"65000\",\n      \"peer\": \"65000\"\n    },\n    \"message\": {\n      \"update\": {\n        \"attribute\": {\n          \"origin\": \"igp\",\n          \"med\": 0,\n          \"local-preference\": 100\n        },\n        \"announce\": {\n          \"ipv4 unicast\": {\n            \"172.16.2.10\": {\n              \"1.1.1.0/24\": {},\n              \"10.10.0.0/24\": {},\n              \"100.10.10.0/24\": {}\n            }\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n// Peer sends EoR (End of RIB) to notify ExaBGP has received all prefixes\n{\n  \"exabgp\": \"3.4.8\",\n  \"time\": 1435450105,\n  \"host\": \"packetgeek.local\",\n  \"pid\": \"93361\",\n  \"ppid\": \"92918\",\n  \"counter\": 16,\n  \"type\": \"update\",\n  \"neighbor\": {\n    \"ip\": \"172.16.2.10\",\n    \"address\": {\n      \"local\": \"172.16.2.1\",\n      \"peer\": \"172.16.2.10\"\n    },\n    \"asn\": {\n      \"local\": \"65000\",\n      \"peer\": \"65000\"\n    },\n    \"message\": {\n      \"eor\": {\n        \"afi\": \"ipv4\",\n        \"safi\": \"unicast\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n// Peer withdraws the 100.10.10.0/24 prefix\n{\n  \"exabgp\": \"3.4.8\",\n  \"time\": 1435450170,\n  \"host\": \"packetgeek.local\",\n  \"pid\": \"93361\",\n  \"ppid\": \"92918\",\n  \"counter\": 17,\n  \"type\": \"update\",\n  \"neighbor\": {\n    \"ip\": \"172.16.2.10\",\n    \"address\": {\n      \"local\": \"172.16.2.1\",\n      \"peer\": \"172.16.2.10\"\n    },\n    \"asn\": {\n      \"local\": \"65000\",\n      \"peer\": \"65000\"\n    },\n    \"message\": {\n      \"update\": {\n        \"withdraw\": {\n          \"ipv4 unicast\": {\n            \"100.10.10.0/24\": {}\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n// Connection with peer 172.16.2.10 is torn down\n{\n  \"exabgp\": \"3.4.8\",\n  \"time\": 1435450190,\n  \"host\": \"packetgeek.local\",\n  \"pid\": \"93361\",\n  \"ppid\": \"92918\",\n  \"counter\": 18,\n  \"type\": \"state\",\n  \"neighbor\": {\n    \"ip\": \"172.16.2.10\",\n    \"address\": {\n      \"local\": \"172.16.2.1\",\n      \"peer\": \"172.16.2.10\"\n    },\n    \"asn\": {\n      \"local\": \"65000\",\n      \"peer\": \"65000\"\n    },\n    \"state\": \"down\",\n    \"reason\": \"out loop, peer reset, message [closing connection] error[the TCP connection was closed by the remote end]\"\n  }\n}\n\nAs you can see, there's plenty of useful information provided in these messages in a very easy to consume JSON format. Here's&nbsp;a summary of the values in messages:\n\nDetails about ExaBGP are contained in each message (Version, localhost, process ID)\nBGP Message type: State (related to OPEN), Notification, Update, and Keepalive\nABGP neighbor section to show peer &nbsp;associated with the message and the message content \n\nThis section will contain the route announcement/withdraw/EoR info\n\n\n\nJust to show the process of storing these messages in our MongoDB database, let's pretend we're working on an app that will monitor the status of ExaBGP peers and send alerts if a peer connection is shutdown or keepalives haven't been received in a certain amount of time. For this app, we will only need to hold onto the state and keepalive messages. Go ahead and check out&nbsp;this&nbsp;example syslog script in the ExaBGP repo that reads from STDIN, as I will be using it&nbsp;as a base for this next&nbsp;example.\nInstead of storing the entire JSON message in MongoDB, I will create a summarized version with just the info needed for the app (type, peer, time, and state info). This example also converts the timestamp to a python datetime object so it's a little easier to work with in our app. Here's the python example to do this using the syslog-1.py script mentioned earlier as a base (I've preserved the original comments to help):\n#!/usr/bin/env python\nimport json\nimport os\nfrom sys import stdin, stdout\nfrom pymongo import MongoClient\n\n###  DB Setup ###\nclient = MongoClient()\ndb = client.exabgp_db\nupdates = db.bgp_updates\n\ndef message_parser(line):\n    # Parse JSON string  to dictionary\n    temp_message = json.loads(line)\n\n    # Convert Unix timestamp to python datetime\n    timestamp = datetime.fromtimestamp(temp_message['time'])\n\n    if temp_message['type'] == 'state':\n        message = {\n            'type': 'state',\n            'time': timestamp,\n            'peer': temp_message['neighbor']['ip'],\n            'state': temp_message['neighbor']['state'],\n        }\n\n        return message\n\n    if temp_message['type'] == 'keepalive':\n        message = {\n            'type': 'keepalive',\n            'time': timestamp,\n            'peer': temp_message['neighbor']['ip'],\n        }\n\n        return message\n\n    # If message is a different type, ignore\n    return None\n\ncounter = 0\nwhile True:\n    try:\n        line = stdin.readline().strip()\n        \n        # When the parent dies we are seeing continual newlines, so we only access so many before stopping\n        if line == \"\":\n            counter += 1\n            if counter &amp;gt; 100:\n                break\n            continue\n        counter = 0\n        \n        # Parse message, and if it's the correct type, store in the database\n        message = message_parser(line)\n        if message:\n            updates.insert_one(message)\n\n    except KeyboardInterrupt:\n        pass\n    except IOError:\n        # most likely a signal during readline\n        pass\n\n\nThis example assumes you have MongoDB and pymongo installed and are running it on the same host as ExaBGP with the default port.\n\nSo now if we were to connect to this database from the frontend app that will monitor BGP peer status, we can use the pymongo library to check for keepalives in the last 5 minutes from peer 172.16.2.10 like this:\n#!/usr/bin/env python\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta\nfrom pymongo import MongoClient, DESCENDING\n\n###  DB Setup ###\nclient = MongoClient()\ndb = client.exabgp_db\nupdates = db.bgp_updates\n\ndef peer_is_up(peer_ip):\n\n    # Find keepalives in last 5 minutes, True or False based on count\n    has_keepalives = bool(updates.find({'peer': peer_ip, 'time': {'$gt': datetime.now() - timedelta(minutes=5)}}).count())\n\n    # Check latest state message for this peer\n    state_message = list(updates.find({'type': 'state', 'peer': peer_ip}).sort('time', DESCENDING).limit(1))\n    state = state_message[0]['state']\n\n    if has_keepalives and state == 'up':\n        return True\n    else:\n        return False\n\npeer = '172.16.2.10'\npeer_status = peer_is_up(peer)\n\nif peer_status:\n    print 'Peer %s is up.' % peer\nelse:\n    print 'Peer %s is down.' % peer\n\nThis was just an introduction to working with the JSON messages from ExaBGP and storing them in a MongoDB for querying purposes. There's plenty of potential with access to the UPDATE messages from neighbors.

Defaults to WPA-PWK).\n\nOnly_Summaries\nUsing&nbsp;only_summaries&nbsp;will return packets in the capture object with just the summary info of each packet (similar to the default output of tshark):\n&gt;&gt;&gt; cap = pyshark.FileCapture('test.pcap', only_summaries=True)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print cap[0]\n2 0.512323 0.512323 fe80::f141:48a9:9a2c:73e5 ff02::c SSDP 208 M-SEARCH * HTTP/\n\nThis option makes the capture file reading much faster, although each packet will only have the attributes shown below available. This info can be plenty if you're just wanting to get the IP addresses to build a conversation list in the sniff, or maybe some bandwidth statistics with the time and packet lengths:\n&gt;&gt;&gt; pkt.     #(tab auto-complete)\npkt.delta         pkt.info          pkt.no            pkt.stream        pkt.window\npkt.destination   pkt.ip id         pkt.protocol      pkt.summary_line\npkt.host          pkt.length        pkt.source        pkt.time\n\nKeep_Packets\nPyShark only reads packets into memory when it's about to do something with the packets. As you work through the packets, PyShark appends each packet to a list attribute of the capture object named _packet. When working with a large amount of packets this list can take up a lot of memory so PyShark gives us the option to only keep one packet in memory at a time. If keep_packets is set to False (default is True), PyShark will read in a packet and then flush it from memory when it moves on to read in the next packet. I have found that this speeds up the processing time of packet iteration a bit, and every second helps!\nDisplay_Filter and BPF_Filter\nThe filters available in these modules can be helpful in keeping your application focused on the traffic you're wanting to analyze. Similar to Wireshark or tshark sniffing, a BPF filter can be used to specify interesting traffic that makes it into the returned capture object. BPF filters don't offer as much flexibility as Wireshark's display filters, but you'd be surprised how creative you can be with the available keywords and offset filters. For help with BPF filters used in capturing packets, check out Wireshark's guide here. Here's an example of using a BPF filter when sniffing to target HTTP traffic:\n&gt;&gt;&gt; cap = pyshark.LiveCapture(interface='en0', bpf_filter='ip and tcp port 80')\n&gt;&gt;&gt; cap.sniff(timeout=5)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; cap\n   &amp;lt;LiveCapture (21 packets)&amp;gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print cap[5].highest_layer\nHTTP\n\nWhen reading in a saved capture file, you can use the display_filter option to harness Wireshark's amazing dissectors to limit the packets returned. Here's the first few packets in my test.pcap file without a filter:\n&gt;&gt;&gt; cap = pyshark.FileCapture('test.pcap')\n&gt;&gt;&gt; for pkt in cap:\n...:    print pkt.highest_layer\n...:\nHTTP\nHTTP\nHTTP\nTCP\nHTTP\n... (truncated)\n\nAnd with a display filter for DNS traffic only:\n&gt;&gt;&gt; cap = pyshark.FileCapture('test.pcap', display_filter=\"dns\")\n&gt;&gt;&gt; for pkt in cap:\n...:    print pkt.highest_layer\n...:\nDNS\nDNS\nDNS\nDNS\nDNS\n... (truncated)\n\n&nbsp;Caveats with LiveCapture\nI discovered a strange behavior when trying to iterate through a LiveCapture returned capture object. It appears that when you try to iterate through the list, it starts the sniff over again and iterates in real time (as packets are received on the interface).&nbsp;There's no way (that I've found yet) to store the packets, the LiveCapture is meant to process packets in real time only.\nThere are some powerful options for opening and sniffing packets for processing. Check out&nbsp;the next article here where I explain what can be done with the capture object that is returned from these modules.\n","id":"https://thepacketgeek.com/pyshark/capture-modules/","title":"FileCapture and LiveCapture modules"},"https://thepacketgeek.com/pyshark/capture-object/":{"body":"Now that we know how to use the FileCapture and LiveCapture modules to capture some packets, let's see what options we have with the returned capture object (truncated list for brevity):\n&gt;&gt;&gt; dir(cap)\nOut[3]:\n['apply_on_packets',\n 'close',\n 'current_packet',\n 'display_filter',\n 'encryption',\n 'input_filename',\n 'next',\n 'next_packet']\n\n\nThese are the methods/attributes that I feel are actually useful, most of the other ones are used for debugging or internally for the capture process. The display_filter, encryption, input_filename attributes are used for displaying parameters passed into &nbsp;FileCapture or LiveCapture.\nThe real magic here is the apply_on_packets() and next() methods. Iteration (via for loop) is available because of the next() method, and apply_on_packets() is another way to iterate through the packets, passing in a function to apply to each packet:\n&gt;&gt;&gt; cap = pyshark.FileCapture('test.pcap', keep_packets=False)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; def print_highest_layer(pkt)\n...: print pkt.highest_layer\n&gt;&gt;&gt; cap.apply_on_packets(print_highest_layer)\nHTTP\nHTTP\nHTTP\nHTTP\nHTTP\n...

PyShark is a wrapper for the Wireshark CLI interface, tshark, so all of the Wireshark decoders are available to PyShark! It is so amazing that I started a new project just so I could use this amazing new tool: Cloud-Pcap.\nYou can use PyShark to sniff from a interface or open a saved capture file, as the docs show on the overview page here:\nimport pyshark\n\n# Open saved trace file \ncap = pyshark.FileCapture('/tmp/mycapture.cap')\n\n# Sniff from interface\ncapture = pyshark.LiveCapture(interface='eth0')\ncapture.sniff(timeout=10)\n&lt;LiveCapture (5 packets)&gt;\n\n\nOnce a capture object is created, either from a LiveCapture or FileCapture method, several methods and attributes are available at both the capture and packet level. &nbsp;The power of PyShark is the access to all of the packet decoders built into tshark. &nbsp;I'm going to just give a sneak peek of some of the things you can do in this post and there will be a few accompanying posts that follow to go more in depth.\n\nGetting packet summaries (similar to tshark capture output):\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; for pkt in cap:\n...:     print pkt\n...:\n2 0.512323 0.512323 fe80::f141:48a9:9a2c:73e5 ff02::c SSDP 208 M-SEARCH * HTTP/\n3 1.331469 0.819146 fe80::159a:5c9f:529c:f1eb ff02::c SSDP 208 M-SEARCH * HTTP/\n4 2.093188 0.761719 192.168.1.1 239.255.255.250 SSDP 395 NOTIFY * HTTP/1.  0x0000 (0)\n5 2.096287 0.003099 192.168.1.1 239.255.255.250 SSDP 332 NOTIFY * HTTP/1.  0x0000 (0)\n\nThis will give access to attributes like packet number, relative and delta times, IP addresses, protocol, and a brief info line.\n\nDrilling down into packet attributes by layer:\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; pkt.   #(tab auto-complete)\npkt.captured_length     pkt.highest_layer       pkt.ip                  pkt.pretty_print        pkt.transport_layer\npkt.eth                 pkt.http                pkt.layers              pkt.sniff_time          pkt.udp\npkt.frame_info          pkt.interface_captured  pkt.length              pkt.sniff_timestamp\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; pkt[pkt.highest_layer].    #(tab auto-complete)\npkt_app.                 pkt_app.get_field_value  pkt_app.raw_mode         pkt_app.request_version\npkt_app.DATA_LAYER       pkt_app.get_raw_value    pkt_app.request\npkt_app.chat             pkt_app.layer_name       pkt_app.request_method\npkt_app.get_field        pkt_app.pretty_print     pkt_app.request_uri\n\n\nIterating through the packets and applying a function to each:\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; cap = pyshark.FileCapture('test.pcap', keep_packets=False)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; def print_highest_layer(pkt)\n...: print pkt.highest_layer\n&gt;&gt;&gt; cap.apply_on_packets(print_highest_layer)\nHTTP\nHTTP\nHTTP\nHTTP\nHTTP\n...

I've thrown a lot of packets at PyShark&nbsp;and it can really slow down once you start running through captures of a couple thousand packets. Some things have been done to preserve memory that will be covered in the following posts.\nI certainly hope you're as excited as I am at this point. There's plenty more to come, so check back soon!\n","id":"https://thepacketgeek.com/pyshark/intro-to-pyshark/","title":"Intro to PyShark"},"https://thepacketgeek.com/pyshark/packet-object/":{"body":"So far in this series we've done a lot with capturing packets and working with the capture object, but finally we're going to get to the fun part and finally start playing with some PACKETS!!!!\nWhen we have captured packets in a capture object, they are stored as a list of packet objects. &nbsp;These packet objects will have methods and attributes that give us access to the header and payload info of each packet. &nbsp;As stated in a previous post we have control&nbsp;for how much info about the packets we store in each packet option through the only_summaries argument in the LiveCapture and ReadCapture modules.\nPacket Summary Attributes\nSetting only_summaries to True during capture will give us a fixed set of attributes, regardless of the protocols present in the packet. The most useful attributes available are:\n&gt;&gt;&gt; cap = pyshark.FileCapture('test.pcap', only_summaries=True)\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; dir(cap[0])\n['delta', 'destination', 'info', 'ip id', 'length', 'no', 'protocol', 'source', 'stream', 'summary_line', 'time', 'window']\n\n\ndelta: Delta (difference) time between the current packet and the previous captured packet\ndestination: The Layer 3 (IP, IPv6) destination address\ninfo: A brief application layer summary (e.g. ‘HTTP GET /resource_folder/page.html')\nip id: IP Identification field used for&nbsp;uniquely identifying packets from a host\nlength: Length of the packet in bytes\nno: Index number of the packet in the list\nprotocol: The highest layer protocol recognized&nbsp;in the packet\nsource:&nbsp;&nbsp;Layer 3 (IP, IPV6) source address\nstream: Index of the TCP stream this packet is a part of (TCP packets only)\nsummary_line: All the summary attributes in one tab-delimited string\ntime: Absolute time between the current packet and the first packet\nwindow: The TCP window size (TCP packets only)\n\nThere's a lot that you can do with just these items; printing out packet summaries is just the beginning! Great visual charts can be made to illustrate IP conversations, bandwidth usage, protocol breakdowns, and application performance measurements (round-trip-times in the same TCP stream). Wow, that's a lot of useful analysis.. but wait, there's more?!?\nFull Packet Attributes\nIf you're wanting to get more than just the summary info out of the capture packets then you're in the right place. Using the dissectors available in Wireshark and tshark, PyShark is able to break out all packet details by layer. For example, let's dig into this DNS packet first by looking at the attributes of the parent packet object:\n&gt;&gt;&gt; cap = pyshark.LiveCapture(interface='en0', bpf_filter='udp port 53')\n&gt;&gt;&gt; cap.sniff(packet_count=50)\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; dns_1 = cap[0]\n&gt;&gt;&gt; dns_2 = cap[1]\n&gt;&gt;&gt; dns_1.      #(tab auto-complete)\ndns_1.captured_length     dns_1.highest_layer       dns_1.length              dns_1.transport_layer\ndns_1.dns                 dns_1.interface_captured  dns_1.pretty_print        dns_1.udp\ndns_1.eth                 dns_1.ip                  dns_1.sniff_time\ndns_1.frame_info          dns_1.layers              dns_1.sniff_timestamp\n\nThere are several generic packet info attributes for&nbsp;length, frame_info, and time, and a pretty_print() method for displaying the packet in a very readable format (similar to Wireshark's packet detail view). If you look close though you'll see attributes that represent absolute&nbsp;layers (eth and ip) as well as attributes that change based on the protocols present in each packet (transport_layer, highest_layer, dns). &nbsp;If you're looking for &nbsp;specific traffic, these attributes make it very easy to locate the packets containing interesting information, like this script that will print out all DNS query and response names:\nimport pyshark\n\ncap = pyshark.LiveCapture(interface='en0', bpf_filter='udp port 53')\n\ncap.sniff(packet_count=10)\n\ndef print_dns_info(pkt):\n    if pkt.dns.qry_name:\n        print 'DNS Request from %s: %s' % (pkt.ip.src, pkt.dns.qry_name)\n    elif pkt.dns.resp_name:\n        print 'DNS Response from %s: %s' % (pkt.ip.src, pkt.dns.resp_name)\n\ncap.apply_on_packets(print_dns_info, timeout=100)\n\nWhich gives the output:\nDNS Request from 10.10.10.40: apple.com\nDNS Request from 10.10.10.1: apple.com\nDNS Request from 10.10.10.40: ipv6.icanhazip.com\nDNS Request from 10.10.10.1: ipv6.icanhazip.com\nDNS Request from 10.10.10.40: ipv4.icanhazip.com\nDNS Request from 10.10.10.1: ipv4.icanhazip.com\n\n&nbsp;Dynamic Layer References\nUsing the dynamic layer attributes I mentioned earlier gives us some flexibility when analyzing packets. If you try to access the pkt.dns.qry_resp attribute of every packet, you will receive an AttributeError if the packet doesn't have DNS info. This also applies to transport layer, since each packet will have either a TCP or UDP layer. We can print out the source and destination addresses and ports (for IP conversation mapping) and use a try/except loop to protect against the AttributeError if the packet is neither TCP nor UDP:\nimport pyshark\n\ncap = pyshark.FileCapture('test.pcap')\n\ndef print_conversation_header(pkt):\n    try:\n        protocol =  pkt.transport_layer\n        src_addr = pkt.ip.src\n        src_port = pkt[pkt.transport_layer].srcport\n        dst_addr = pkt.ip.dst\n        dst_port = pkt[pkt.transport_layer].dstport\n        print '%s  %s:%s --&gt; %s:%s' % (protocol, src_addr, src_port, dst_addr, dst_port)\n    except AttributeError as e:\n        #ignore packets that aren't TCP/UDP or IPv4\n        pass\n\ncap.apply_on_packets(print_conversation_header, timeout=100)\n\nWhich gives the output:\nUDP  10.10.10.12:51554 --&gt; 239.255.255.250:1900\nUDP  10.10.10.12:51554 --&gt; 239.255.255.250:1900\nUDP  10.10.10.15:58803 --&gt; 8.8.8.8:53\nUDP  8.8.8.8:53 --&gt; 10.10.10.15:58803\nTCP  10.10.10.15:58632 --&gt; 192.168.20.197:80\nTCP  192.168.20.197:80 --&gt; 10.10.10.15:58632\nTCP  10.10.10.15:58632 --&gt; 192.168.20.197:80\n\n&nbsp;Endless Possibilities\nAs you can see from just these few examples is that PyShark gives access to all packet details with ease. Conditional statements could be used to create dynamic logic for categorizing and working with many different protocols, or you can search for certain types of traffic that have a specific attribute (make sure to protect for AttributeErrors).\nI hope you've enjoyed these last few posts. I'd love to hear about projects that you come up with using PyShark, so feel free to share!

This article will focus on an improved Retryable struct (with RetryStrategy) that we'll then build a new macro to simplify instantation for.\nRetryable &amp; RetryStrategy\nForgoing macros for a bit, let's setup some retry structs and implementations. First is a Retryable struct to contain our function/closure to retry, and a RetryStrategy with options for retrying (number of retries, delay, etc.):\npub struct Retryable&lt;F, T, E&gt;\nwhere\n    F: FnMut() -&gt; Result&lt;T, E&gt;,\n{\n    inner: F,\n    strategy: RetryStrategy,\n}\n\n/// Specification for how the retryable should behave\npub struct RetryStrategy {\n    retries: usize,\n    delay: RetryDelay,\n}\n\npub enum RetryDelay {\n    Fixed(std::time::Duration),\n    // TODO: More options here\n}\n\nThe core of our implementation for this struct looks like the retry logic from retry!, although we now use the delay options from RetryStrategy.\nimpl&lt;F, T, E&gt; Retryable&lt;F, T, E&gt;\nwhere\n    F: FnMut() -&gt; Result&lt;T, E&gt;,\n{\n    /// Start calling the wrapped function, responding to Errors\n    /// as the specified strategy dictates\n    pub fn try_call(&amp;mut self) -&gt; Result&lt;T, E&gt; {\n        let mut retries = self.strategy.retries;\n        let mut delay_time = Duration::from_millis(0);\n        loop {\n            std::thread::sleep(delay_time);\n            let res = (self.inner)();\n            if res.is_ok() {\n                break res;\n            }\n            if retries &gt; 0 {\n                retries -= 1;\n                delay_time = self.next_run_time();\n                continue;\n            }\n            break res;\n        }\n    }\n\n    fn next_run_time(&amp;self) -&gt; Duration {\n        match self.strategy.delay {\n            RetryDelay::Fixed(delay) =&gt; delay,\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nBreaking out this logic into the RetryStrategy gives us much more flexibility with retrying, but now we have a problem with a more tedius setup:\nlet strategy = RetryStrategy::default().with_retries(3).to_owned();\nlet mut r = Retryable::new(succeed_after!(2), strategy);\nlet res = r.try_call();\nassert!(res.is_ok());\n\nAutomating Retryable Setup\nLuckily for us we have an awesome tool in the toolbox that we can use to make this setup much easier: a macro! Using some similar matching rules we used with retry!, we can setup a very flexible macro to allow for optional specification of retries:\nmacro_rules! retryable {\n    // Take a closure with retry count\n    // ```ignore\n    // retryable!(|| { do_something(1, 2, 3, 4) }; retries=2);\n    // ```\n    ($f:expr; retries=$r:expr) =&gt; {{\n        let _strategy = RetryStrategy::default().with_retries($r).to_owned();\n        let mut _r = Retryable::new($f, _strategy);\n        _r.try_call()\n    }};\n    // Take a function ptr, variadic args, and retry count\n    // ```ignore\n    // retryable!(my_fallible_func, 0, \"something\"; retries=5);\n    // ```\n    ($( $args:expr $(,)? )+; retries=$r:expr) =&gt; {{\n        retryable!(|| { _wrapper!($($args,)*)}; retries=$r)\n    }};\n\nWe now have a very similar usage to our previous retry! macro:\nlet res = retryable!(sometimes_fail, 10; retries = 15);\nassert!(res.is_ok());\n\nAlthough how about setting the delay value via macro invocation? For that we'll need to add a couple more rules to support delay on its own, and also with both retries and delay specified:\nmacro_rules! retryable {\n    // ... existing rules\n\n    // Take a function ptr, variadic args, and delay time (seconds)\n    // ```ignore\n    // retryable!(my_fallible_func, 0, \"something\"; delay=5);\n    // ```\n    ($($args:expr$(,)?)+; delay=$d:expr) =&gt; {{\n        retryable!(|| { _wrapper!($($args,)*)}; delay=$d)\n    }};\n    // Take a function ptr, variadic args, retry count, and delay time (seconds)\n    // ```ignore\n    // retryable!(my_fallible_func, 0, \"something\"; retries=2; delay=5);\n    // ```\n    ($($args:expr$(,)?)+; retries=$r:expr; delay=$d:expr) =&gt; {{\n        retryable!(|| { _wrapper!($($args,)*)}; retries=$r; delay=$d)\n    }};\n\nNow look at how easy retryable! is to use!\nlet res = retryable!(sometimes_fail, 10; delay = 2);\nassert!(res.is_ok());\n\nlet res = retryable!(|| {sometimes_fail(10)}; retries = 15; delay = 1);\nassert!(res.is_ok());\n\nMuch better that the manual Retryable/RetryStrategy setup!! Check out the full implementation to see how the macro also supports delay timers and more.\n","id":"https://thepacketgeek.com/rust/macros/improved-retry-macro-setup/","title":"Improved Retryable Logic with Macro Setup"},"https://thepacketgeek.com/rust/macros/intro/":{"body":"This series serves as a practical (but not-exhaustive) introduction to declarative macro_rules!. I've put together some Rust macro examples to show how macros can be helpful for improving ergonomics around repetitive or error-prone tasks. The examples cover some great scenarios for macros like:\n\nPrint out the time a block of code takes to execute\nAdding retries around intermittently fallible code\nMaking data structure initialization easier for common options\n\nWhat are macros?\nTo introduce macros, I'll take a direct quote from the Macro chapter in the Rust Book:\n\nMacros allow us to abstract at a syntactic level. A macro invocation is shorthand for an \"expanded\" syntactic form. This expansion happens early in compilation, before any static checking. As a result, macros can capture many patterns of code reuse that Rust’s core abstractions cannot.\n\nThe example given shows how vec![], which you're likely used, is a shorthand alternative to a tedious Vec instantiation:\nlet my_values: Vec&lt;u3&gt; = vec![10, 20, 30, 40];\n\nbecomes:\nlet my_values = {\n    let mut temp_vec: Vec&lt;u32&gt; = Vec::new();\n    temp_vec.push(10);\n    temp_vec.push(20);\n    temp_vec.push(30);\n    temp_vec.push(40);\n    temp_vec\n}\n\nWhat we'll cover in this post is how we can use macro_rules! to create our own shorthand abstractions.\nViewing macro output\nAs we start building some macros I'll be showing output of the generated Rust code using cargo-expand. It's an invaluable tool to see what the macro_rules! code is generating. I recommend installing cargo-expand to be able to follow along and test out your own macros.\nDefining Macros with macro_rules!\nRust has a special syntax for declaring macros via macro_rules! blocks. Macros will have one or more match rules, to allow the macro to match &amp; parse the tokens &amp; expressions withing the invoking call. In that way, you'll see some similarities to Rust's match blocks and value destructuring. Let's look at how the syntax is laid out:\n/* |--- Tell Rust compiler: this is a macro definition\n   v           v-- macro name (how it will be called)  */\nmacro_rules! macro_name {\n/*   |--- Match rule\n     v          v -- macro name (how it will be called)  */\n    (...) =&gt; { ... }\n    // more match rules\n}\n\nTo see the full details on macro syntax, check out the Rust Book's Syntax section. The rest of this post will cover just a subset of topics.\nBuilding timeit!()\nThe rest of this artcle will focus on a building a timeit! macro, inspired by Python's timeit module. It will allow us to log the execution time for closures &amp; functions; here's a usage example:\nfn wait_for_it() -&gt; String {\n    std::thread::sleep(std::time::Duration::from_secs(2));\n    return String::from(\"...Legendary!\");\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    eprintln!(\"This is going to be...\");\n    let res = timeit!(wait_for_it());\n    eprintln!(\"{}\", res);\n}\n\noutput\nThis is going to be...\n'wait_for_it' took 2002 ms\n...Legendary!\n\nImplementing timeit!\nThe essence of the syntax timeit! is trying to create shorthand for is:\n{\n    let start_time = std::time::Instant::now();\n    // Code to time goes here\n    eprintln!(\"Took {:.3} ms\", start_time.elapsed().as_millis());\n}\n\nWrapping a Closure via Matching and Expanding\nThe first use case has the most straight-forward since the closere is matched in macro_rules! as a single expr match type:\nmacro_rules! timeit {\n    // This match captures the `expr` passed in as `$e`,\n    // which the macro will assume is callable (E.g. a closure or function)\n    ($e:expr) =&gt; {{\n        // Before calling `$e`, track the current instant\n        let _start = std::time::Instant::now();\n        // `$e` could return something (or the implied unit struct `()`), so capture that in `_res`\n        let _res = $e();\n        // Log the elapsed time\n        eprintln!(\"Took {:.3} ms\", _start.elapsed().as_millis());\n        // and return whatever our closure returned\n        _res\n    }};\n}\n\nWhich allows us to use the macro like:\nuse std::io;\nuse std::fs::read_to_string;\n\nfn main() -&gt; io::Result&lt;()&gt; {\n    let file_contents = read_to_string(\"path/to/file.txt\")?;\n    let result = timeit!(|| {\n        my_lib::process_file(&amp;file_contents)\n    });\n    println!(\"{}\", results);\n    Ok(())\n}\n\noutput\nTook 0.150 ms\nResults: ...\n\nWrapping a Function Call\nMuch like Rust's match blocks, ordering of rules is significant and the first pattern that matches will get executed. We can use this to our advantage and have a match rule that will attempt to match on function calls so that we can automatically include the function name in the logging output (to reduce ambiguity in code with multiple timeit! calls).\nRepetitive Matches and Expansion\nMatch rules can match an arbitrary number of homegenious items, much like the values passed into vec![...]. There isn't a match rule setup for each possibility of passed arguments, but rather the variadic arguments are captured in a match and the macro rule block can repeat syntax for each arg (like the temp_vec.push(...); lines in vec![]).\nGiven a macro call like:\nvec![10, 20, 30]\n\nThe match rule could look like:\n( $($args:expr),*) )\n//     ^--- A repeating series of `expr` with non-captured comma separators\n\nAfter capturing, a representation of the matches might look something like:\n$args = [10, 20, 30]\n\nWhen using the captured $args in the macro block, they can be re-assembled with comma separators like:\nlet mut temp_vec = Vec::new();\n/*\n v-- things inside $( .. )* are repeated per item */\n$(\n   temp_vec.push($args);\n)*\n\nExploding and Re-assembling a Function Call\nIn order to attempt matching a function call, we'll place a new match rule at the beginning of our macro_rules! block, so when it doesn't match the rule the macro will proceed to the next rule to find a match:\nmacro_rules! timeit {\n    /*  |--- function name (in this case: slow_sum)\n        v     v--- the open paren before the function args   */\n    ($n:ident ( $($args:expr),*)) =&gt; {{\n    /*                ^          ^--- the closing paren after the function args)\n                      |--- A repeating series of `arg` with non-captured comma separators */\n        let _start = std::time::Instant::now();\n\n        //              v--------v -&gt; repeat each arg with following comma\n        let _res = $n( $( $args, )* );\n        //          ^--- our captured function name\n\n        // Use the function name (ident) in the log\n        eprintln!(\"'{}' took {:.3} ms\", stringify!($n), _start.elapsed().as_millis());\n\n        // return whatever the result of our function is (pass-through, like `dbg!()`)\n        _res\n    }};\n    ($e:expr) =&gt; {{ .. }}  // &lt;-- our existing rule\n}\n\nAnd we can see the effect of our macro via cargo-expand, targeted at our macro tests:\n#[test]\nfn test_simple() {\n    timeit!(|| { std::thread::sleep(std::time::Duration::from_secs(1)) });\n}\n\nBecomes (comments added by me):\n`$ cargo expand --lib --tests tests::test_simple\nfn test_simple() {\n//  v-- Start of our macro block\n    {\n        // This you should recognize\n        let _start = std::time::Instant::now();\n        // And this is `$e();` expanded\n        let _res = (|| std::thread::sleep(std::time::Duration::from_secs(1)))();\n        // Followed by the expansion of `eprintln!()`\n        {\n            ::std::io::_eprint(::core::fmt::Arguments::new_v1_formatted(\n                &amp;[\"Took \", \" ms\\n\"], // &lt;-- This is us!\n                &amp;match (&amp;_start.elapsed().as_millis(),) {\n                    (arg0,) =&gt; [::core::fmt::ArgumentV1::new(\n                        arg0,\n                        ::core::fmt::Display::fmt,\n                    )],\n                },\n                &amp;[::core::fmt::rt::v1::Argument {\n                    position: 0usize,\n                    format: ::core::fmt::rt::v1::FormatSpec {\n                        fill: ' ',\n                        align: ::core::fmt::rt::v1::Alignment::Unknown,\n                        flags: 0u32,\n                        precision: ::core::fmt::rt::v1::Count::Is(3usize),\n                        width: ::core::fmt::rt::v1::Count::Implied,\n                    },\n                }],\n            ));\n        };\n        _res\n    };\n}\n\nAnd our function call example:\n#[test]\nfn test_ext_multiple_args() {\n    fn slow_sum(a: u32, b: u32) -&gt; u32 {\n        std::thread::sleep(std::time::Duration::from_secs(2));\n        a + b\n    }\n    let res = timeit!(slow_sum(5, 9));\n    eprintln!(\"Slow sum result: {}\", res);\n}\n\nBecomes (comments added by me):\n$ cargo expand --lib --tests tests::test_ext_multiple_args\nfn test_ext_multiple_args() {\n    fn slow_sum(a: u32, b: u32) -&gt; u32 {\n        std::thread::sleep(std::time::Duration::from_secs(2));\n        a + b\n    }\n    //        v-- Start of our macro block\n    let res = {\n        let _start = std::time::Instant::now();\n        let _res = slow_sum(5, 9);\n        {\n            ::std::io::_eprint(::core::fmt::Arguments::new_v1_formatted(\n                &amp;[\"\\'\", \"\\' took \", \" ms\\n\"],\n                //        v-- The function name, after `stringify!()`\n                &amp;match (&amp;\"slow_sum\", &amp;_start.elapsed().as_millis()) {\n                    (arg0, arg1) =&gt; [\n                        ::core::fmt::ArgumentV1::new(arg0, ::core::fmt::Display::fmt),\n                        ::core::fmt::ArgumentV1::new(arg1, ::core::fmt::Display::fmt),\n                    ],\n                },\n                //.. truncated for brevity\n            ));\n        };\n        _res  // &lt;-- returning the function result\n    };  // &lt;-- end of the macro block\n    {\n        ::std::io::_eprint(::core::fmt::Arguments::new_v1(\n            &amp;[\"Slow sum result: \", \"\\n\"],\n            &amp;match (&amp;res,) {\n                (arg0,) =&gt; [::core::fmt::ArgumentV1::new(\n                    arg0,\n                    ::core::fmt::Display::fmt,\n                )],\n            },\n        ));\n    };\n}\n\nThere we have it!

Check out the full example for even more details, along with some tests to show usage.\n","id":"https://thepacketgeek.com/rust/macros/intro/","title":"First Macro: timeit!"},"https://thepacketgeek.com/rust/macros/macro-matching-and-nesting/":{"body":"We previously covered a very basic declarative macro that wrapped some timing logic around a function to be run. This article expands on that with some additional matching techinques to build a retry! macro to be used like:\nlet res = retry!(|| { sometimes_fail(10) });\nassert!(res.is_ok());\n\nlet res = retry!(sometimes_fail, 10; retries = 3);\nassert!(res.is_ok());\n\nRetrying Functions\nFunctions can fail. Some failures are persistent, like trying to open an invalid file path or parsing numeric values out of a string that doesn't contain numbers. Other failures are intermittent, like attempting to read data from a remote server. In the intermittent case it can be useful to have some logic to retry the attempted call in hopes for a successful result. This is exactly what our retry! macro will do!\nHere's a function that fails with a given failure rate that we'll use to illustrate the retry functionality:\nuse rand::Rng;\n\n/// Given a failure rate percentage (0..=100),\n/// fail with that probability\nfn sometimes_fail(failure_rate: u8) -&gt; Result&lt;(), ()&gt; {\n    assert!(failure_rate &lt;= 100, \"Failure rate is a % (0..=100)\");\n    let mut rng = rand::thread_rng();\n    let val = rng.gen_range(0u8, 100u8);\n    if val &gt; failure_rate {\n        Ok(())\n    } else {\n        Err(())\n    }\n}\n\nRetry Logic\nBefore we dive into writing our retry! macro, let's look at what retrying a fallible function looks like in Rust. A helpful way to approach writing macros is to:\n\nWrite the code in non-macro form\nLook at what parts should/could be parameterized\nBuild a macro for a specific use case\nExpand to include additional use cases when it makes sense\n\nA pre-req for our retryable logic is that the function or closure the code is retrying should return Result. This allows us to check the Result variant (Ok/Err) and retry accordingly. A example of this is:\nlet mut retries = 3;  // How many times to retry on error\n\nlet func = || { sometimes_fail(10) };\n// Loop until we hit # of retries or success\nlet res = loop {\n    // Run our function, capturing the Result in `res`\n    let res = func();\n    // Upon success, break out the loop and return the `Result::Ok`\n    if res.is_ok() {\n        break res;\n    }\n    // Otherwise, decrement retries and loop around again\n    if retries &gt; 0 {\n        retries -= 1;\n        continue;\n    }\n    // When retries have been exhausted, finally return the `Result::Err`\n    break res;\n};\n\nassert!(res.is_ok());\n\nThe first thing to parameterize for this macro is the function that's being called (in this case, sometimes_fail). Turning our logic into macro form would look something like:\nmacro_rules! retry {\n    ($f:expr) =&gt; {{\n        let mut retries = 3;\n        loop {\n            let res = $f();\n            if res.is_ok() {\n                break res;\n            }\n            if retries &gt; 0 {\n                retries -= 1;\n                continue;\n            }\n            break res;\n        }\n    }};\n}\n\nThis mostly looks similar to our non-macro code above, but I'll explain the match rule ($f:expr) a bit. This rule will only allow a single expression to be passed into the macro. Additionally, since we're eventually calling the expr like $f(), the expression must be something that results in a function. So a closure seems like a perfect fit and this macro can be used like (playground):\nlet res = retry!(|| sometimes_fail(10));\nassert!res.is_ok());\n\nCurrently, we can't pass a function directly (E.g. retry!(sometimes_fail(10)) as the macro expansion would end up like:\n// ...\n    let res = sometimes_fail(10)();\n// ...\n\nAnd we can't call the Result that sometimes_fail(10) returns. To make this work we should look at using yet another macro to coerce closures &amp; functions into a common form for the retry! macro.\nNesting Macros\nTo keep the retry! macro_rules implementation clean, we'll create another macro (_wrapper!) to faciliate the passing of closures or functions with arguments which will add this additional use case to our examples above:\n// Alternate func + args invocation\nlet res = retry!(sometimes_fail(10));\nassert!(res.is_ok());\n\nLet's implement the case covered in retry! already:\nmacro_rules! _wrapper {\n    // Single expression (like a function name or closure)\n    ($f:expr) =&gt; {{\n        $f()\n    }};\n}\n\nI'm using _wrapper as the name here to signal that it's intended to be use internally by the retry! macro and won't be exported by this library (perhaps a bad habit coming from Python). We can now use this example to get the same functionality as the prior retry! macro example:\nmacro_rules! retry {\n    ($f:expr) =&gt; {{\n        let mut retries = 3;\n        loop {\n            let res = _wrapper!($f);\n            if res.is_ok() {\n                break res;\n            }\n            if retries &gt; 0 {\n                retries -= 1;\n                continue;\n            }\n            break res;\n        }\n    }};\n}\n\nAs far as functionality goes, nothing has been added here, but this will enable us to build matching logic for our multiple use-cases within _wrapper! instead of duplicating code in retry! for different match rules.\nRepeating matches\nSomething we learned with the timeit! macro was that we can match on repeating items, and then add code-expansion for each item. We'll use that same trick here to match on multiple arguments for the case of a function &amp; args being passed into retry!:\nmacro_rules! _wrapper {\n    ($f:expr) =&gt; {{ /* code from previous section */ }};\n    // Variadic number of args (Allowing trailing comma)\n    ($f:expr, $( $args:expr $(,)? )* ) =&gt; {{\n        $f( $($args,)* )\n    }};\n}\n\nThere's a lot going on in this single line so let's break it down:\n\n$f:expr: The function passed in for retrying\n,: Comma separator before the function arguments\n$( .. )*: Anything in these parentheses can repeat (zero or more times, like * in regex)\n$args:expr: Capture each repeating expr into $args\n$(,)?: Allow optional commas (? == 0 or 1 times, like regex )\n\nThis match rule will capture something like _wrapper!(my_func, 10, 20) into something that resembles:\n\n$f == my_func\n$args == [10, 20]\n\nAnd let's break down the expansion: $f( $( $args, )* ):\n\n$f( ... ): Function name, with literal parenthesis wrapping whatever is inside\n$( ... )*: Repeat what's inside per expr in $args\n$args,: Write out an expr, followed by a literal comma\n\nWhich expands to:\nmy_func(10, 20,)\n\nWith these two match rules inside _wrapper!, we can now successfully use retry! with all of the use cases! Check out the final implementation of _wrapper! and accompanying tests here.\nWe'll need to update the retry! macro to accept a variable number of args to use _wrapper! correctly, which looks like:\nmacro_rules! retry {\n    ($( $args:expr$(,)? )+) =&gt; {{\n        let mut retries = 3;\n        loop {\n            let res = _wrapper!($( $args, )*);\n            if res.is_ok() {\n                break res;\n            }\n            if retries &gt; 0 {\n                retries -= 1;\n                continue;\n            }\n            break res;\n        }\n    }};\n}\n\nThe match rule for retry! should now be a bit more familiar, and what this rule is doing is passing along whatever $args are passed in retry! along to _wrapper!.\nRecursive Macros\nThe next item in the macro that makes sense for parameterization is the number of retries. We've been using 3 as a default, but should allow that to be specified where retry! is used. For the purpose of DRY, I'll show you how macros can be used recursively to allow multiple match rules using the same code expansion.\nLet's consider how one might specify the number of retries to use. The retry! macro currently takes an arbitrary number of arguments separated by commas, so we'll need a new separator to prevent ambiguity. A possible future of this macro might support additional parameters like delay time, so we should make the retries parameter explicit to avoid confusion and allow macro changes down the road.\nHere's the macro with a ; separator, and note that we are matching retries= which will be explicity used in the macro call.\nmacro_rules! retry {\n    ($( $args:expr$(,)? )+; retries=$r:literal) =&gt; {{\n        let mut retries = 3;\n        loop {\n            let res = _wrapper!($( $args, )*);\n            if res.is_ok() {\n                break res;\n            }\n            if retries &gt; 0 {\n                retries -= 1;\n                continue;\n            }\n            break res;\n        }\n    }};\n}\n\nFor which usage looks like:\nlet res = retry!(sometimes_fail, 10; retries = 3);\nassert!(res.is_ok());\n\nWith this addition of ; retries=$r:literal, we're now requiring this syntax to exist in the macro call. But what if 3 is a good default and we want to give the user an option to not specify retries? We could duplicate the match rules and use the same retry logic in each, but this isn't DRY and there must be a better way! Fortunately for us there is! We can provide a match rule that doesn't require ; retries=X and provide a default value like:\nmacro_rules! retry {\n    ($( $args:expr$(,)? )+; retries=$r:literal) =&gt; {{\n        /* existing retry logic */\n    }};\n    // Function &amp; args only, use default of 3 retries\n    ($( $args:expr$(,)? )+) =&gt; {{\n        retry!($( $args, )*; retries = 3)\n    }};\n}\n\nThis works just like you think it would, a usage of retry!(my_func, 10) skips the first rule and matches the second rule, where ; retries = 3 is added to a recursive call that now matches the first rule.\n\nWe've greatly progressed in macro_rules abilities from the previous timeit! macro and these techniques will get you far! A future article will dive further into retry logic, using macros to instantiate some structs to allow for more flexible retry options.\n","id":"https://thepacketgeek.com/rust/macros/macro-matching-and-nesting/","title":"retry!

In this post we'll look into what it takes to build a custom protocol for message passing more than a single type of thing (like a String).\nDefining our Message Structs\nTo give our client and server more options for communicating we'll create:\n\nA Request message that allow the client to request either:\n\nEcho a string\nJumble a string with a specified amount of jumbling entropy\n\n\nA Response message for the server to respond with the successfully echo/jumbled String\n\nlib.rs\n/// Request object (client -&gt; server)\n#[derive(Debug)]\npub enum Request {\n    /// Echo a message back\n    Echo(String),\n    /// Jumble up a message with given amount of entropy before returning\n    Jumble { message: String, amount: u16 },\n}\n\n/// Response object from server\n///\n/// In the real-world, this would likely be an enum as well to signal Success vs. Error\n/// But since we're showing that capability with the `Request` struct, we'll keep this one simple\n#[derive(Debug)]\npub struct Response(pub String);\n\nSerialization\nIn the previous demos, we relied on String::as_bytes() to serialize the String characters to the byte slice (&amp;[u8]) we pass to TcpStream::write_all(). The structs defined above don't have any default serialization capabilities so this example focuses on how to implement that ourselves.\nSerialization/Deserialization Libraries\nQuick detour: As you'll soon find out, serializing our custom structs is a lot of work. The good news is that there are some really incredible, performant, and battle-tested libraries to make doing this easier! It's fun to study how this can be implemented, but I highly recommend checking out these libraries for your actual serialization needs:\n\nSerde\ntokio_util::codec\nbincode\n\nSerializing the Request struct\nSerialization &amp; Deserialization needs to be symmetric (i.e., it round-trips) so that the struct serialized by the client is deserialized by the server back into an identical struct.\nSerializing Symmetry (round-trip) pseudo-code:\nlet message = Request { ... };\n\n// Equivalent to std::str::from_utf8(\"Hello\".as_bytes())\nlet roundtripped_message = deserialize_message(serialize_message(&amp;message));\n\n// Symmetric serialization means these will match (given the struct has `Eq`)\nassert_eq!(message, roundtripped_message);\n\nIn order to serialize Request we need to decide what it looks like on the wire (as a [u8]). Since Request has two \"types\" (Echo and Jumble), we'll need to encode that type info to instruct the deserialization code correctly. Here is an approach for the Request byte layout:\n|    u8    |     u16     |     [u8]      | ... u16    |   ... [u8]       |\n|   type   |    length   |    bytes      | ... length |   ... bytes      |\n           ^---    struct field        --^--   possibly more fields?   --^-- ...\n\n\ntype: A codified representation of the Request type\n\nE.g. Echo == 1, Jumble == 2\n\n\nlength/bytes: The Length and Value from Type-Length-Value [TLV]\n\nEach message struct has specific field types so we can get away with only LV, but TLV is useful when fields are variadic and not derivable otherwise\n\n\npossibly more fields:\n\nAgain, each message struct knows it's fields for deserialization, so these length/byte groups can repeat for each member field when needed (like in the case of Jumble)\n\n\n\nWe know how to serialize a String with as_bytes(), but for number values we can use byteorder to serialize with the correct Endianness (spoiler: BigEndian, aliased as NetworkEndian). Let's walk through the serialization steps:\nRequest Type\nAs we can see above we need to codify our Request types (Echo and Jumble) into a number (u8, which allows us up to 255 types!). To make this definition clear we can implement From for Request -&gt; u8 to have a consistent way of serializing the type:\nlib.rs\nuse std::convert::From;\n\n/// Encode the Request type as a single byte (as long as we don't exceed 255 types)\n///\n/// We use `&amp;Request` since we don't actually need to own or mutate the request fields\nimpl From&lt;&amp;Request&gt; for u8 {\n    fn from(req: &amp;Request) -&gt; Self {\n        match req {\n            Request::Echo(_) =&gt; 1,\n            Request::Jumble { .. } =&gt; 2,\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nRequest Fields\nLet's finish the building blocks for serializing the Request with examples for writing the length/value for String and numbers:\nString is straightforward and we've used as_bytes() in previous demos, and byteorder adds extension methods to Write for numbers:\nuse std::io::{self, Write};\nuse byteorder::{NetworkEndian, WriteBytesExt};\n\nlet mut bytes: Vec&lt;u8&gt; = vec![];  // Just an example buffer that supports `Write`\n\nlet message = String::from(\"Hello\");\n// byteorder in action\nbytes.write_u16::&lt;NetworkEndian&gt;(message.len()).unwrap();\nbytes.write_all(message.as_bytes()).unwrap();\n\nWrite Request\nWe now have all the pieces to add a method for Request that receives a mutable reference to some buffer that implements Write (like our TcpStream :)), and serialize a Request::Echo:\nlib.rs\n/// Starts with a type, and then is an arbitrary length of (length/bytes) tuples\nimpl Request {\n    /// Serialize Request to bytes (to send to server)\n    pub fn serialize(&amp;self, buf: &amp;mut impl Write) -&gt; io::Result&lt;()&gt; {\n        // Derive the u8 Type field from `impl From&lt;&amp;Request&gt; for u8`\n        buf.write_u8(self.into())?;\n\n        // Select the serialization based on our `Request` type\n        match self {\n            Request::Echo(message) =&gt; {\n                // Write the variable length message string, preceded by it's length\n                let message = message.as_bytes();\n                buf.write_u16::&lt;NetworkEndian&gt;(message.len() as u16)?;\n                buf.write_all(&amp;message)?;\n            }\n            Request::Jumble { message, amount } =&gt; {\n                todo!()\n            }\n        }\n        Ok(())\n    }\n}\n\nNow the Request::Jumble serialization is just a slight variation (adding the amount field after the message):\nlib.rs\n// ...\n        match self {\n            // ... \n            Request::Jumble { message, amount } =&gt; {\n                // Write the variable length message string, preceded by it's length\n                let message_bytes = message.as_bytes();\n                buf.write_u16::&lt;NetworkEndian&gt;(message_bytes.len() as u16)?;\n                buf.write_all(&amp;message_bytes)?;\n\n                // We know that `amount` is always 2 bytes long\n                buf.write_u16::&lt;NetworkEndian&gt;(2)?;\n                // followed by the amount value\n                buf.write_u16::&lt;NetworkEndian&gt;(*amount)?;\n            }\n        }\n/// ...\n\nTada! A serialized Request in the bank! The Response struct is even simpler with its single String value, so you can review the serialization code in the demo lib.rs\nDeserializing the Request struct\nWe already have the byte layout figured out so deserializing should essentially be the reverse of our Request::serialize() method above. byteorder also gives us ReadBytesExt to add extensions to Read that TcpStream implements. The trickiest part is reading the variable length String and this will happen in a few places for Request::Echo, Request::Jumble, and Response so let's break out this logic into a function:\nlib.rs\n/// From a given readable buffer (TcpStream), read the next length (u16) and extract the string bytes ([u8])\nfn extract_string(buf: &amp;mut impl Read) -&gt; io::Result&lt;String&gt; {\n    // byteorder ReadBytesExt\n    let length = buf.read_u16::&lt;NetworkEndian&gt;()?;\n\n    // Given the length of our string, only read in that quantity of bytes\n    let mut bytes = vec![0u8; length as usize];\n    buf.read_exact(&amp;mut bytes)?;\n\n    // And attempt to decode it as UTF8\n    String::from_utf8(bytes).map_err(|_| io::Error::new(io::ErrorKind::InvalidData, \"Invalid utf8\"))\n}\n\nOur deserialize() method should be straight-forward to read now especially with extract_string at our disposal:\nlib.rs\nuse std::io::{self, Read};\nuse byteorder::{NetworkEndian, ReadBytesExt};\n\n\nimpl Request {\n    /// Deserialize Request from bytes (to receive from TcpStream)\n    /// returning a `Request` struct\n    pub fn deserialize(mut buf: &amp;mut impl Read) -&gt; io::Result&lt;Request&gt; {\n        /// We'll match the same `u8` that is used to recognize which request type this is\n        match buf.read_u8()? {\n            // Echo\n            1 =&gt; Ok(Request::Echo(extract_string(&amp;mut buf)?)),\n            // Jumble\n            2 =&gt; {\n                let message = extract_string(&amp;mut buf)?;\n                // amount length is not used since we know it's 2 bytes\n                let _amount_len = buf.read_u16::&lt;NetworkEndian&gt;()?;\n                let amount = buf.read_u16::&lt;NetworkEndian&gt;()?;\n                Ok(Request::Jumble { message, amount })\n            }\n            _ =&gt; Err(io::Error::new(\n                io::ErrorKind::InvalidData,\n                \"Invalid Request Type\",\n            )),\n        }\n    }\n\n}\n\nWow! We now have the ability to test round-tripping of our structs!\nlib.rs\nuse crate::*;\nuse std::io::Cursor;\n\n#[test]\nfn test_request_roundtrip() {\n    let req = Request::Echo(String::from(\"Hello\"));\n\n    let mut bytes: Vec&lt;u8&gt; = vec![];\n    req.serialize(&amp;mut bytes).unwrap();\n\n    let mut reader = Cursor::new(bytes); // Simulating our TcpStream\n    let roundtrip_req = Request::deserialize(&amp;mut reader).unwrap();\n\n    assert!(matches!(roundtrip_req, Request::Echo(_)));\n    assert_eq!(roundtrip_req.message(), \"Hello\");\n}\n\nUsing our new Protocol\nIf you're still with me here, congrats! That was a lot of work and you're about to see how it all pays off when we use the message structs in our client and server.\nI'll leave it up as an exercise to check out the full protocol implementation where we add Serialize and Deserialize traits for our methods above and make using our protocol as easy as:\nclient.rs\nuse std::io;\n\nfn main() -&gt; io::Request&lt;()&gt; {\n    let req = Request::Jumble {\n        message: \"Hello\",\n        amount: 80,\n    };\n    \n    Protocol::connect(\"127.0.0.1:4000\")\n        .and_then(|mut client| {\n            client.send_message(&amp;req)?;\n            Ok(client)\n        })\n        .and_then(|mut client| client.read_message::&lt;Response&gt;())\n        .map(|resp| println!(\"{}\", resp.message()))\n}\n\n","id":"https://thepacketgeek.com/rust/tcpstream/create-a-protocol/","title":"Create a Custom Protocol"},"https://thepacketgeek.com/rust/tcpstream/lines-codec/":{"body":"In the previous post we learned how to read &amp; write bytes with TcpStream, but the calling code had to be aware of that and do the serialization/deserialization.  In this demo, we'll continue using BufRead and BufReader to build:\n\nA LinesCodec that abstracts away String serialization/deserialization &amp; TcpStream I/O\nA client that uses the LinesCodec to send and print returned Strings\nA server that also uses the LinesCodec and reverses Strings before echoing them back\n\nLinesCodec\nOur goals for this LinesCodec implementation are to abstract away:\n\nTcpStream reading &amp; writing\n\nWe know enough about this now to know that the client &amp; server shouldn't worry about the correct incantation to send &amp; receive data\nEven copy/pasting the code around is bound to cause an issue (like a forgotten stream.flush())\n\n\nString serialization &amp; deserialization\n\nThe client/server code shouldn't care how the data is represented on the wire, our codec will take care of that!\n\n\n\nA Type to the rescue!\nStarting off with the I/O management abstraction, let's define a new type to own and interact with TcpStream. From the previous post, we know we'll want to use the BufReader and its read_line() method for reading data.\nFor writing data, we have three options:\n\nUse TcpStream directly, identical to what we did in the previous post\nUse BufWriter which is a good logical jump given our use of BufReader\nUse LineWriter which sounds like an even closer match to what we want\n\nI'm choosing to use LineWriter because it seems like a better approach to what we're wanting to do, based of of its documentation:\n\nWraps a writer and buffers output to it, flushing whenever a newline (0x0a, \\n) is detected.\nThe BufWriter struct wraps a writer and buffers its output. But it only does this batched write when it goes out of scope, or when the internal buffer is full. Sometimes, you'd prefer to write each line as it's completed, rather than the entire buffer at once. Enter LineWriter. It does exactly that.\n\nGreat! Let's define our type and define LinesCodec::new() to build new instances:\nlib.rs\nuse std::io::{self, BufRead, Write};\nuse std::net::TcpStream;\n\npub struct LinesCodec {\n    // Our buffered reader &amp; writers\n    reader: io::BufReader&lt;TcpStream&gt;,\n    writer: io::LineWriter&lt;TcpStream&gt;,\n}\n\nimpl LinesCodec {\n    /// Encapsulate a TcpStream with buffered reader/writer functionality\n    pub fn new(stream: TcpStream) -&gt; io::Result&lt;Self&gt; {\n        // Both BufReader and LineWriter need to own a stream\n        // We can clone the stream to simulate splitting Tx &amp; Rx with `try_clone()`\n        let writer = io::LineWriter::new(stream.try_clone()?);\n        let reader = io::BufReader::new(stream);\n        Ok(Self { reader, writer })\n    }\n}\n\nReading and Writing\nWith the LinesCodec struct and its buffered reader/writers, we can continue our implementation to borrow the reading and writing code from the previous post:\nlib.rs\n...\nimpl LinesCodec {\n    /// Write the given message (appending a newline) to the TcpStream\n    pub fn send_message(&amp;mut self, message: &amp;str) -&gt; io::Result&lt;()&gt; {\n        self.writer.write(&amp;message.as_bytes())?;\n        // This will also signal a `writer.flush()` for us; thanks LineWriter!\n        self.writer.write(&amp;['\\n' as u8])?;\n        Ok(())\n    }\n\n    /// Read a received message from the TcpStream\n    pub fn read_message(&amp;mut self) -&gt; io::Result&lt;String&gt; {\n        let mut line = String::new();\n        // Use `BufRead::read_line()` to read a line from the TcpStream\n        self.reader.read_line(&amp;mut line)?;\n        line.pop(); // Remove the trailing \"\\n\"\n        Ok(line)\n    }\n}\n\nUsing LinesCodec in the client\nWith the TcpStream out of the way, let's refactor our client code from the previous post and see how easy this can be:\nclient.rs\nuse std::io;\nuse std::new::TcpStream;\n\nuse crate::LinesCodec;\n\n\nfn main() -&gt; io::Result&lt;()&gt; {\n    // Establish a TCP connection with the farend\n    let mut stream = TcpStream::connect(\"127.0.0.1:4000\")?;\n\n    // Codec is our interface for reading/writing messages.\n    // No need to handle reading/writing directly\n    let mut codec = LinesCodec::new(stream)?;\n\n    // Serializing &amp; Sending is now just one line\n    codec.send_message(\"Hello\")?;\n\n    // And same with receiving the response!\n    println!(\"{}\", codec.read_message()?);\n    Ok(())\n\n}\n\nUsing LinesCodec in the server\nAnd now we have some very similar work to update our server to use LinesCodec. We'll define a handle_connection function that:\n\nTakes ownership of a TcpStream and wraps it in LinesCodec\nReceives a message (String) from the client and reverses it\nSends the message back to the client, again using LinesCodec\n\nserver.rs\nuse std::io;\nuse std::net::TcpStream;\n\nuse crate:LinesCodec;\n\n/// Given a TcpStream:\n/// - Deserialize the message\n/// - Serialize and write the echo message to the stream\nfn handle_connection(stream: TcpStream) -&gt; io::Result&lt;()&gt; {\n    let mut codec = LinesCodec::new(stream)?;\n\n    // Read &amp; reverse the received message\n    let message: String = codec\n        .read_message()\n        // Reverse message\n        .map(|m| m.chars().rev().collect())?;\n\n    // And use the codec to return it\n    codec.send_message(&amp;message)?;\n    Ok(())\n}\n\nUsing the codec makes the business logic code much clearer and there are fewer opportunities to mis-manage newlines or forget flush(). Check out the demo client and server code for a full runnable example.\nIn the next post we dive even deeper to build a custom protocol with our own serialization/deserialization!\n","id":"https://thepacketgeek.com/rust/tcpstream/lines-codec/","title":"Building a LinesCodec"},"https://thepacketgeek.com/rust/tcpstream/reading-and-writing/":{"body":"For the start of our journey with TcpStream we'll take a look at what it takes to send and receive raw bytes.\nThis demo is going to build up some concepts that result in a demo found here. The working concept is that we want to have a client send some data (a String) to a server that will echo the message back to the client. In further demos, we'll progress this concept to do slightly more interesting things with the data on the server before sending back.\nWriting Data\nLet's start with our client and figuring out how to send the message bytes (String characters) to the server. TcpStream's implementation of the Write trait gives us functionality to write data to the stream (allowing TCP to send bytes across the wire).\nwrite()\nThe write() method takes a slice of bytes (&amp;[u8]) and attempts to queue them in the TcpStream's buffer (without sending on the wire yet) and returns the number of bytes successfully written as a usize. If more bytes are written than can be buffered, write() signals this with a usize less than the length of bytes sent (which you can see with the bytes_written variable in examples coming soon).\nAfter queuing the bytes in the TCP buffer, flush() signals to TCP that it should send the bytes. As the last bytes are sent, the PSH bit will be set to signal to the receiving TCP stack that this data is ready to send to the application.\nclient.rs\nuse std::io::{self, Write};\nuse std::net::TcpStream;\n\nfn main() -&gt; io::Result&lt;()&gt; {\n    // Establish a TCP connection with the farend\n    let mut stream = TcpStream::connect(\"127.0.0.1:4000\")?;\n\n    // Buffer the bytes\n    let _bytes_written = stream.write(b\"Hello\")?;\n    // Tell TCP to send the buffered data on the wire\n    stream.flush()?;\n\n    Ok(())\n}\n\nTo prevent missing data, the bytes_written should be validated and signaled if not all the data could be written, which could look like this:\nclient.rs\n...\n    let data = b\"Hello\";\n    let bytes_written = stream.write(data)?;\n\n    if bytes_written &lt; data.len() {\n        return Err(io::Error::new(\n            io::ErrorKind::Interrupted,\n            format!(\"Sent {}/{} bytes\", bytes_written, data.len()),\n        ));\n    }\n\n    stream.flush()?;\n...\n\nwrite_all()\nValidating the bytes queued is a common enough pattern to warrant a dedicated method to save us some work: write_all(). A simplified version of the example above becomes:\nclient.rs\nuse std::io::{self, Write};\nuse std::net::TcpStream;\n\nfn main() -&gt; io::Result&lt;()&gt; {\n    let mut stream = TcpStream::connect(\"127.0.0.1:4000\")?;\n    \n    // write_all() will return Err(io::Error(io::ErrorKind::Interrupted))\n    // if it is unable to queue all bytes\n    stream.write_all(b\"Hello\")?;\n    stream.flush()\n}\n\nThis is what the the TcpStream looks like in Wireshark. Notice the PSH bit set on the packet 5 (carrying the data segment \"Hello\"):\n\nReading Data\nCounterpart to the Write trait's write()/write_all(), the Read trait gives us read() for the ability to read received bytes from a TcpStream. It can be a bit more nuanced than Write and I'll show you why you'll tend to want to use the BufRead trait with BufReader.\nread()\nThe read() method takes a mutable reference (&amp;mut) to a buffer (like a Vec&lt;u8&gt; or [u8]) and will attempt to fill this buffer with received bytes. The nuanced side of read() is knowing how many bytes to read, as reading to a growable array will cause an error since it can't be filled:\nError(\"failed to fill whole buffer\")\n\nSo, knowing how many bytes to read would be easy if we knew that the messages received are always a fixed size:\nserver.rs\nuse std::io::{self, Read};\nuse std::net::TcpStream;\n\nconst MESSAGE_SIZE: usize = 5;\n\nfn main() -&gt; io::Result&lt;()&gt; {\n    let mut stream = TcpStream::connect(\"127.0.0.1:4000\")?;\n\n    // Array with a fixed size\n    let mut rx_bytes = [0u8; MESSAGE_SIZE];\n    // Read from the current data in the TcpStream\n    stream.read(&amp;mut rx_bytes)?;\n\n    let received = std::str::from_utf8(&amp;rx_bytes).expect(\"valid utf8\");\n    eprintln!(\"{}\", received);\n    Ok(())\n}\n\nYet we live in a world with variable length strings and the approach above doesn't quite work out. However read() returns a usize of bytes_read, so we can get fancy reading to our statically sized array repeatedly until we have no more bytes to read:\nserver.rs\n...\n    let mut stream = TcpStream::connect(\"127.0.0.1:4000\")?;\n\n    // Store all the bytes for our received String\n    let mut received: Vec&lt;u8&gt; = vec![];\n\n    // Array with a fixed size\n    let mut rx_bytes = [0u8; MESSAGE_SIZE];\n    loop {\n        // Read from the current data in the TcpStream\n        let bytes_read = stream.read(&amp;mut rx_bytes)?;\n\n        // However many bytes we read, extend the `received` string bytes\n        received.extend_from_slice(&amp;rx_bytes[..bytes_read]);\n\n        // If we didn't fill the array\n        // stop reading because there's no more data (we hope!)\n        if bytes_read &lt; MESSAGE_SIZE {\n            break;\n        }\n    }\n\n    String::from_utf8(received)\n        .map(|msg| println!(\"{}\", msg))\n        .map_err(|_| {\n            io::Error::new(\n                io::ErrorKind::InvalidData,\n                \"Couldn't parse received string as utf8\",\n            )\n        })\n...\n\nAlas, there are some issues with this code. Each time read() is called can be a syscall to fetch bytes from the TCP stack and we're also stuck with the decision of how to size the fixed length array:\n\nA large array (E.g. &gt; 512 bytes) can waste stack space for bytes we may never read\nA small array results in more calls to read(), which may be expensive\n\nFortunately though there's a solution for us...\nBufRead and BufReader\nThe BufRead trait and BufReader give us some really convenient read capabilities:\n\nfill_buf() and consume() - a tag team of methods to read &amp; verify data\nread_line() (or the Iterator version: lines()) allow us to read by line (String ending with a newline)\n\nYou can see this one in action to create a LinesCodec in the next article\n\n\n\nfill_buff() and consume()\nInstead of repeatedly trying to fill an array with bytes, BufRead offers a fill_buf() method which returns a slice to all the bytes in the buffer, super convenient!\nfill_buf() does not free/drop the bytes read; a subsequent call to consume() is necessary to tell the BufReader that the bytes were successfully read and it can move its internal cursor. This combo is helpful in the case where TCP may not have received all the data yet, and your code needs to check for a delimiter (cough like a newline cough) or certain number of bytes:\nserver.rs\nuse std::io::{self, BufRead};\nuse std::net::TcpStream;\n\nfn main() -&gt; io::Result&lt;()&gt; {\n    let mut stream = TcpStream::connect(\"127.0.0.1:4000\")?;\n    \n    // Wrap the stream in a BufReader, so we can use the BufRead methods\n    let mut reader = io::BufReader::new(&amp;mut stream);\n\n    // Read current current data in the TcpStream\n    let received: Vec&lt;u8&gt; = reader.fill_buf()?.to_vec();\n\n    // Do some processing or validation to make sure the whole line is present?\n    // ...\n\n    // Mark the bytes read as consumed so the buffer will not return them in a subsequent read\n    reader.consume(received.len());\n\n    String::from_utf8(received)\n        .map(|msg| println!(\"{}\", msg))\n        .map_err(|_| {\n            io::Error::new(\n                io::ErrorKind::InvalidData,\n                \"Couldn't parse received string as utf8\",\n            )\n        })\n}\n\nConclusion\nWe've covered how to read and write bytes with TcpStream but it could be easier for us. The next article will expand on the usage of BufRead to build a Lines Codec to abstract away the read/write detail in the client and server code.\n","id":"https://thepacketgeek.com/rust/tcpstream/reading-and-writing/","title":"Reading and Writing Data"},"https://thepacketgeek.com/scapy/":{"body":"","id":"https://thepacketgeek.com/scapy/","title":"Scapy"},"https://thepacketgeek.com/scapy/building-network-tools/":{"body":"","id":"https://thepacketgeek.com/scapy/building-network-tools/","title":"Building Network Tools with Scapy"},"https://thepacketgeek.com/scapy/building-network-tools/part-01/":{"body":"What is Scapy?\nNo one can introduce Scapy better than the creator of the project himself:\n\nScapy is a powerful interactive packet manipulation program. It is able to forge or decode packets of a wide number of protocols, send them on the wire, capture them, match requests and replies, and much more. It can easily handle most classical tasks like scanning, tracerouting, probing, unit tests, attacks or network discovery\nIt also performs very well at a lot of other specific tasks that most other tools can't handle, like sending invalid frames, injecting your own 802.11 frames, combining technics (VLAN hopping+ARP cache poisoning, VOIP decoding on WEP encrypted channel, ...), etc.\n\n\nPhil @  secdev.org\n\nWorking with Scapy\nPython is the foundation of Scapy and is the biggest dependency, but the good news is that Python can run on almost any system! If you're using a Mac or some flavor of *nix, it's probably already installed on your computer. Since Scapy is built on Python, you have the full functionality of Python including control blocks, conditional statements, and all of the available modules. The possiblilies are virtually limitless when it comes to building your own network tools.\nI'm not a programmer, how easy is Scapy to use?\nScapy is used via a command-line interactive mode or inside Python scripts, but after reading through this guide you should be able to do most of the basics with Scapy. Scapy has its own syntax, so you don't need to know much Python to get started. Python is a very friendly language to learn though and a little extra studying will widen what you can do with Scapy and your network tools.\nIf you're interested in learning more about Python I highly recommend these resources:\n\nCodeacademy\nLearning Python\nLearn Python the Hard Way\n\n","id":"https://thepacketgeek.com/scapy/building-network-tools/part-01/","title":"Scapy p.01"},"https://thepacketgeek.com/scapy/building-network-tools/part-02/":{"body":"Installing Python\nScapy was originally written for Python 2, but since the 2.4 release (March 2018), you can now use Scapy with Python 3.4+! I will prefer Python 3 in examples but will also include notes about big differences between each python version and Scapy if they exist.\n\nIf you're using a Mac or running some version of *nix you probably already have Python 2 (and maybe even Python 3) installed. To check, open a terminal and type python3 or python. You should see something like this:\nlocalhost:~ packetgeek$ python3\nPython 3.7.2 (v3.7.2:9a3ffc0492, Dec 24 2018, 02:44:43)\n[Clang 6.0 (clang-600.0.57)] on darwin\nType \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n\nIf you are running Windows or for some other reason do not have Python installed already, go to the Python download page and grab the installer for your platform.\n\nInstalling Scapy\nThere are multiple ways to install Scapy depending on your platform. Check out the Scapy installation guides to find instructions and installer packages relevant to your platform. Once Scapy is installed, you should be able to run it from the terminal, just like we did with Python, and get something that looks like this:\nlocalhost:~ packetgeek$ scapy\n\n                     aSPY//YASa\n             apyyyyCY//////////YCa       |\n            sY//////YSpcs  scpCY//Pp     | Welcome to Scapy\n ayp ayyyyyyySCP//Pp           syY//C    | Version 2.4.2\n AYAsAYYYYYYYY///Ps              cY//S   |\n         pCCCCY//p          cSSps y//Y   | https://github.com/secdev/scapy\n         SPPPP///a          pP///AC//Y   |\n              A//A            cyP////C   | Have fun!\n              p///Ac            sC///a   |\n              P////YCpc           A//A   | We are in France, we say Skappee.\n       scccccp///pSP///p          p//Y   | OK?

Run scapy from the terminal and run the conf command. See what interface Scapy will use by default by looking at the iface value:\nlocalhost:~ packetgeek$ scapy\nWelcome to Scapy (2.4.3)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; conf.iface\n'en0'\n\n\nScapy on my computer is defaulted to my en0 (Wifi) interface\n\nIf the default interface is not the one you will use, you can change the value like this:\n&gt;&gt;&gt; conf.iface=\"en3\"\n\n\n*Instead of en3, use the interface you want to be your default\n\nIf you are constantly switching back and forth between interfaces, you can specify the interface to use when you run Scapy commands. Here are some Scapy functions and how you might use the iface argument. You'll learn more about these functions and other arguments soon.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; sniff(count=10, iface=\"en3\")\n&gt;&gt;&gt; send(pkt, iface=\"en3\")\n\nRoot Permissions\nFor some of the Scapy functions dealing with sending traffic, you will need to be able to run Scapy as root. For example, on a Mac/Linux computer you can run interactive mode with root permissions by running sudo scapy from the CLI. Also, you can run the Python scripts with Scapy send functions as sudo like this:\n$ sudo python3 script.py\n\nIf you ever receive a Python error about not having the correct permissions or something not be allowed, try running Scapy with root permissions.\n","id":"https://thepacketgeek.com/scapy/building-network-tools/part-02/","title":"Scapy p.02"},"https://thepacketgeek.com/scapy/building-network-tools/part-03/":{"body":"Running Scapy\nScapy can be run in two different modes, interactively from a terminal window and programmatically from a Python script.

I'll at least introduce most of these commands, and there are a few that we'll use extensively. For the next few topics, we'll specifically be covering: ls(), send(), sniff(), and sr*().\nIn fact, let's go ahead and use one of those now to show off some of the amazing built in capabilities of Scapy! I'm going to sniff a single packet real quick and then we'll play around with that.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; pkt = sniff(count=1)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; type(pkt)\nscapy.plist.PacketList\n&gt;&gt;&gt; pkt\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; pkt[0].summary()\n'Ether / IP / ICMP 172.16.20.10 &gt;&gt;&gt; 4.2.2.1 echo-request 0 / Raw'\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n\nSo, what I've done here is defined a pkt variable that is equal to whatever sniff() returns. In this case, that will be a single packet since I've passed in the count argument with a value of 1. Our pkt now holds an array containing single packet. If we increased count to a value of 2 or greater, then sniff() will return an array of all those packets. I'll show you how to access each packet individually a little bit later.\nBut wait, how does Scapy know that this packet contains Ethernet, IP and ICMP layers!? I'm glad you asked, Scapy has a wide range of built in protocol support. The list is much to long for me to print out here, so I'll let you run this next command on your own.\nThe explore() function provides a GUI for viewing and selecting protocol layers:\n\nPackets contained in scapy.layers.dns:\nClass                    |Name\n-------------------------|------------------------------\nDNS                      |DNS\nDNSQR                    |DNS Question Record\nDNSRR                    |DNS Resource Record\nDNSRRDLV                 |DNS DLV Resource Record\nDNSRRDNSKEY              |DNS DNSKEY Resource Record\nDNSRRDS                  |DNS DS Resource Record\nDNSRRNSEC                |DNS NSEC Resource Record\nDNSRRNSEC3               |DNS NSEC3 Resource Record\nDNSRRNSEC3PARAM          |DNS NSEC3PARAM Resource Record\nDNSRROPT                 |DNS OPT Resource Record\nDNSRRRSIG                |DNS RRSIG Resource Record\nDNSRRSOA                 |DNS SOA Resource Record\nDNSRRSRV                 |DNS SRV Resource Record\nDNSRRTSIG                |DNS TSIG Resource Record\nEDNS0TLV                 |DNS EDNS0 TLV\nInheritOriginDNSStrPacket|\n\nOr directly explore a specific layer (without the GUI selector):\n&gt;&gt;&gt; explore(scapy.layers.dhcp)\nPackets contained in scapy.layers.dhcp:\nClass|Name\n-----|------------\nBOOTP|BOOTP\nDHCP |DHCP options\n\nYou can also use the ls()&nbsp;command to view the available protocols and fields for each layer. In Scapy Interactive mode, run the ls() command and just look at ALL the supported protocols.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; ls()\nARP        : ARP\nASN1_Packet : None\nBOOTP      : BOOTP\n...\n\nAs you can see, Scapy has a huge range of supported protocols. We'll only work with a handful of those in the upcoming topics but feel free to dig into them more for your own network tools. To see the fields and default values for any protocol, just run the ls() function on the protocol like this:\n&gt;&gt;&gt; ls(Ether)\ndst        : DestMACField         = (None)\nsrc        : SourceMACField       = (None)\ntype       : XShortEnumField      = (0)\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; ls(IP)\nversion    : BitField             = (4)\nihl        : BitField             = (None)\ntos        : XByteField           = (0)\nlen        : ShortField           = (None)\nid         : ShortField           = (1)\nflags      : FlagsField           = (0)\nfrag       : BitField             = (0)\nttl        : ByteField            = (64)\nproto      : ByteEnumField        = (0)\nchksum     : XShortField          = (None)\nsrc        : Emph                 = (None)\ndst        : Emph                 = ('127.0.0.1')\noptions    : PacketListField      = ([])\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; ls(UDP)\nsport      : ShortEnumField       = (53)\ndport      : ShortEnumField       = (53)\nlen        : ShortField           = (None)\nchksum     : XShortField          = (None)\n\nNow that we have a better idea of the Scapy commands and protocol support, let's dig into some packets.\n","id":"https://thepacketgeek.com/scapy/building-network-tools/part-03/","title":"Scapy p.03"},"https://thepacketgeek.com/scapy/building-network-tools/part-04/":{"body":"Packets, Layers, and Fields.

That's what the \nshow() method is for:\n&gt;&gt;&gt; pkt[0].show()\n###[ Ethernet ]###\n  dst= 00:24:97:2e:d6:c0\n  src= 00:00:16:aa:bb:cc\n  type= 0x800\n###[ IP ]###\n     version= 4L\n     ihl= 5L\n     tos= 0x0\n     len= 84\n     id= 57299\n     flags= \n     frag= 0L\n     ttl= 64\n     proto= icmp\n     chksum= 0x0\n     src= 172.16.20.10\n     dst= 4.2.2.1\n     \\options\\\n###[ ICMP ]###\n        type= echo-request\n        code= 0\n        chksum= 0xd8af\n        id= 0x9057\n        seq= 0x0\n###[ Raw ]###\n\nVery cool, that's some good info. If you're familiar with Python you have probably noticed the list index, [0], after the pkt variable name. Remember that our sniff only returned a single packet, but if we increase the count argument value, we will get back an list with multiple packets:\n&gt;&gt;&gt; pkts = sniff(count=10)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; pkts\n&lt;Sniffed: TCP:0 UDP:0 ICMP:10 Other:0&gt;\n\n\nGetting the value of the list returns a quick glance at what type of packets were sniffed.\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; pkts.summary()\nEther / IP / ICMP 172.16.20.10 &gt; 4.2.2.1 echo-request 0 / Raw\nEther / IP / ICMP 4.2.2.1 &gt; 172.16.20.10 echo-reply 0 / Raw\nEther / IP / ICMP 172.16.20.10 &gt; 4.2.2.1 echo-request 0 / Raw\nEther / IP / ICMP 4.2.2.1 &gt; 172.16.20.10 echo-reply 0 / Raw\nEther / IP / ICMP 172.16.20.10 &gt; 4.2.2.1 echo-request 0 / Raw\nEther / IP / ICMP 4.2.2.1 &gt; 172.16.20.10 echo-reply 0 / Raw\nEther / IP / ICMP 172.16.20.10 &gt; 4.2.2.1 echo-request 0 / Raw\nEther / IP / ICMP 4.2.2.1 &gt; 172.16.20.10 echo-reply 0 / Raw\nEther / IP / ICMP 172.16.20.10 &gt; 4.2.2.1 echo-request 0 / Raw\nEther / IP / ICMP 4.2.2.1 &gt; 172.16.20.10 echo-reply 0 / Raw\n\nAnd we can show the summary or packet contents of any single packet by using the list index with that packet value. So, let's look at the contents of the 4th packet (Remember, list indexes start counting at 0):\n&gt;&gt;&gt; pkts[3]\n&lt;Ether  dst=00:00:16:aa:bb:cc src=00:24:97:2e:d6:c0 type=0x800 |&lt;IP  version=4L ihl=5L tos=0x20 len=84 id=47340 flags= frag=0L ttl=57 proto=icmp chksum=0x3826 src=4.2.2.1 dst=172.16.20.10 options=[] |&lt;ICMP  type=echo-reply code=0 chksum=0xcfbf id=0x3060 seq=0x1 |&lt;Raw |&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n\n\nGetting the value of a single packet returns a quick glance of the contents of that packet.\n\nThe show() method will give us a cleaner print out:\n&gt;&gt;&gt; pkts[3].show()\n###[ Ethernet ]###\n  dst= 00:00:16:aa:bb:cc\n  src= 00:24:97:2e:d6:c0\n  type= 0x800\n###[ IP ]###\n     version= 4L\n     ihl= 5L\n     tos= 0x20\n     len= 84\n     id= 47340\n     flags= \n     frag= 0L\n     ttl= 57\n     proto= icmp\n     chksum= 0x3826\n     src= 4.2.2.1\n     dst= 172.16.20.10\n     \\options\\\n###[ ICMP ]###\n        type= echo-reply\n        code= 0\n        chksum= 0xcfbf\n        id= 0x3060\n        seq= 0x1\n###[ Raw ]###\n\nDigging into Packets by Layer\nScapy builds and dissects packets by the layers contained in each packet, and then by the fields in each layer. Each layer is nested inside the parent layer as can be seen with the nesting of the &lt; and &gt; brackets:\n&gt;&gt;&gt; pkts[4]\n&lt;Ether  dst=00:24:97:2e:d6:c0 src=00:00:16:aa:bb:cc type=0x800 |&lt;IP  version=4L ihl=5L tos=0x0 len=84 id=17811 flags= frag=0L ttl=64 proto=icmp chksum=0x0 src=192.168.201.203 dst=4.2.2.1 options=[] |&lt;ICMP  type=echo-request code=0 chksum=0xc378 id=0x3060 seq=0x2 |&lt;Raw |&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n\nYou can also dig into a specific layer using an list index. If we wanted to get to the ICMP layer of pkts[3], we could do that using the layer name or index number:\n&gt;&gt;&gt; pkts[3][ICMP].summary()\n'ICMP 4.2.2.1 &gt; 192.168.201.203 echo-reply 0 / Raw'\n&gt;&gt;&gt; pkts[3][2].summary()\n'ICMP 4.2.2.1 &gt; 192.168.201.203 echo-reply 0 / Raw'\n\nSince the first index chooses the packet out of the pkts list, the second index chooses the layer for that specific packet. Looking at the summary of this packet from an earlier example, we know that the ICMP layer is the 3rd layer.\nPacket .command() Method\nIf you're wanting to see a reference of how a packet that's been sniffed or received might look to create, Scapy has a packet method for you! Using the .command() packet method will return a string of the command necessary to recreate that packet, like this:\n&gt;&gt;&gt; pkts[2].command()\n'Ether(src=\\'00:11:22:aa:bb:cc\\', dst=\\'c0:c1:c0:b7:ce:63\\', type=2048)/IP(frag=0L, src=\\'172.16.20.10\\', proto=1, tos=0, dst=\\'4.2.2.1\\', chksum=51457, len=84, options=[], version=4L, flags=0L, ihl=5L, ttl=64, id=59755)/ICMP(gw=None, code=0, ts_ori=None, addr_mask=None, seq=3, ptr=None, unused=None, ts_rx=None, chksum=50424, reserved=None, ts_tx=None, type=8, id=59999)/Raw(load=\\'Rk\\\\xe8\\\\x02\\\\x00\\\\x0c#\\\\\\'\\\\x08\\\\t\\\\n\\\\x0b\\\\x0c\\\\r\\\\x0e\\\\x0f\\\\x10\\\\x11\\\\x12\\\\x13\\\\x14\\\\x15\\\\x16\\\\x17\\\\x18\\\\x19\\\\x1a\\\\x1b\\\\x1c\\\\x1d\\\\x1e\\\\x1f !\"#$%&amp;\\\\\\'()*+,-./01234567\\')'\n\nDigging into Layers by Field\nWithin each layer, Scapy parses out the value of each field if it has support for the layer's protocol. Depending on the type of field, Scapy may replace the value with a more friendly text value for the summary views, but not in the values returned for an individual field. Here are some examples:\n&gt;&gt;&gt; pkts[3]\n&lt;Ether  dst=00:00:16:aa:bb:cc src=00:24:97:2e:d6:c0 type=0x800 |\\\n&lt;IP  version=4L ihl=5L tos=0x20 len=84 id=47340 flags= frag=0L ttl=57 proto=icmp chksum=0x3826 src=4.2.2.1 dst=192.168.201.203 options=[] |\\\n&lt;ICMP  type=echo-reply code=0 chksum=0xcfbf id=0x3060 seq=0x1 |&lt;Raw |&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; pkts[3][Ether].src\n'00:24:97:2e:d6:c0'\n&gt;&gt;&gt; pkts[3][IP].ttl\n57\n&gt;&gt;&gt; pkts[3][IP].proto\n1\n&gt;&gt;&gt; pkts[3][ICMP].type\n0\n\nUsing Python control statements with Scapy\nThe awesome thing about Scapy being a module of Python is that we can use the power of Python to do stuff with our packets. Here's a tip of the iceberg example using a Python for statement along with some new Scapy packet methods:\n&gt;&gt;&gt; for packet in pkts:\n...     if (packet.haslayer(ICMP)):\n...         print(f\"ICMP code: {packet.getlayer(ICMP).code}\")\n...\nICMP code: 0\nICMP code: 0\nICMP code: 0\nICMP code: 0\nICMP code: 0\nICMP code: 0\nICMP code: 0\nICMP code: 0\nICMP code: 0\nICMP code: 0\n\nAs you can guess, the haslayer() and getlayer() methods will test for the existence of a layer and return the layer (and any nested layers) respectively. This is just a very basic use of Python statements with Scapy and we'll see a lot more when it comes to packet generation and custom actions.\n","id":"https://thepacketgeek.com/scapy/building-network-tools/part-04/","title":"Scapy p.04"},"https://thepacketgeek.com/scapy/building-network-tools/part-05/":{"body":"With a good understanding of how to view our packets we can now move onto some packet generation. Let's talk a bit about sniffing first and how existing packets are our best tool for creating new ones.\nSniff() function arguments\nWe've used the sniff() function a couple times already to capture some packets for viewing. I'm going to explain a little bit more about the sniff() function and its arguments. The arguments we will be talking about are:\n\ncount: Number of packets to capture. 0 means infinity.\niface: Sniff for packets only on the provided interface.\nprn: Function to apply to each packet. If something is returned, it is displayed. For instance you can use prn = lambda x: x.summary().\nstore: Whether to store sniffed packets or discard them. When you only want to monitor your network forever, set store to 0.\ntimeout: Stop sniffing after a given time (default: None).\n\nThese should all be self-explanatory except for the filter and prn arguments. The filter argument takes BPF syntax filters, just like Wireshark or tcpdump capture filters. The prn argument is a very cool capability of the sniff() function and you can read more about it here: Scapy and custom actions.\nSince we want to generate our first ARP packet we should go ahead and sniff one to see what it takes to recreate one using the .show() and .command() method. Here's a sniff using the count and filter arguments:\n&gt;&gt;&gt; pkts = sniff(count=5, filter=\"arp\")\n&gt;&gt;&gt; pkts.summary()\nEther / ARP who has 172.16.20.255 says 172.16.20.40 / Padding\nEther / ARP who has 172.16.20.244 says 172.16.20.40 / Padding\nEther / ARP who has 172.16.20.252 says 172.16.20.40 / Padding\nEther / ARP who has 172.16.20.253 says 172.16.20.40 / Padding\nEther / ARP who has 172.16.20.80 says 172.16.20.74 / Padding\n&gt;&gt;&gt; pkts[0].show()\n###[ Ethernet ]###\n  dst= ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff\n  src= 00:11:22:aa:bb:cc\n  type= 0x806\n###[ ARP ]###\n     hwtype= 0x1\n     ptype= 0x800\n     hwlen= 6\n     plen= 4\n     op= who-has\n     hwsrc= 00:11:22:aa:bb:cc\n     psrc= 172.16.20.40\n     hwdst= 00:00:00:00:00:00\n     pdst= 172.16.20.255\n###[ Padding ]###\n&gt;&gt;&gt; pkts[0].command()\n\"Ether(src='00:11:22:aa:bb:cc', dst='ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff', type=2054)/ARP(hwdst='00:00:00:00:00:00', ptype=2048, hwtype=1, psrc='172.16.20.40', hwlen=6, plen=4, pdst='172.16.20.255', hwsrc='00:11:22:aa:bb:cc', op=2)\"\n\nBuilding a Packet\nIt looks like ARP packets only have 2 layers plus padding that we have to worry about. We can use the ls() function on the Ether and ARP layers to see what options are available to us:\n&gt;&gt;&gt; ls(Ether)\ndst        : DestMACField         = (None)\nsrc        : SourceMACField       = (None)\ntype       : XShortEnumField      = (0)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; ls(ARP)\nhwtype     : XShortField          = (1)\nptype      : XShortEnumField      = (2048)\nhwlen      : ByteField            = (6)\nplen       : ByteField            = (4)\nop         : ShortEnumField       = (1)\nhwsrc      : ARPSourceMACField    = (None)\npsrc       : SourceIPField        = (None)\nhwdst      : MACField             = ('00:00:00:00:00:00')\npdst       : IPField              = ('0.0.0.0')\n\nLet's create our ARP packet and start assigning some values. We construct a new ARP packet, and use the assignment operator customize specific fields of our packet:\n&gt;&gt;&gt; arppkt = Ether()/ARP()\n&gt;&gt;&gt; arppkt[ARP].hwsrc = \"00:11:22:aa:bb:cc\"\n&gt;&gt;&gt; arppkt[ARP].pdst = \"172.16.20.1\"\n&gt;&gt;&gt; arppkt[Ether].dst = \"ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff\"\n&gt;&gt;&gt; arppkt\n&lt;Ether  dst=ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff type=0x806 |&lt;ARP  hwsrc=00:11:22:aa:bb:cc pdst=172.16.20.1 |&gt;&gt;\n\nThe layers we want are defined with the with the Layer() notation. This will work for any layer in the ls() command output. That's a lot of options! You can also define the packet from scratch with all the options in one statement by passing in the fields as arguments to the related layer.\nNote that the special glue holding these packets together is the / operator. If you happen to forget a layer when you're first defining the packet, you can add on a layer very easily using the existing packet and the / operator like this:\n&gt;&gt;&gt; tcppkt = Ether()/IP()\n&gt;&gt;&gt; tcppkt\n&lt;Ether  type=0x800 |&lt;IP  |&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; tcppkt = tcppkt/TCP()\n&gt;&gt;&gt; tcppkt\n&lt;Ether  type=0x800 |&lt;IP  frag=0 proto=tcp |&lt;TCP  |&gt;&gt;&gt;\n\nSending a packet\nYup, you guessed it, its finally time to send this ARP packet out on the wire! Since ARP is a L2 protocol we're going to use the sendp() function as the send() function only works with L3 Packets (IP or IPv6 headers):\n&gt;&gt;&gt; arppkt\n&lt;Ether  dst=ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff src=00:11:22:aa:bb:cc type=0x806 |&lt;ARP  hwsrc=00:11:22:aa:bb:cc pdst=172.16.20.1 |&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; sendp(arppkt)\n.\nSent 1 packets.\n\n\n\nScreenshot of capture packet in Wireshark\n\nWhat, what! Check that out! Our packet out from the scapy console and in the wire! Pretty cool, right? Well, here's a fun fact. We don't need to create and build the packet before sending it, we can define the packet right there in the send() or sendp() function like this:\n&gt;&gt;&gt; sendp(Ether(dst=\"ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff\",src=\"00:11:22:aa:bb:cc\")/ARP(hwsrc=\"00:11:22:aa:bb:cc\",pdst=\"172.16.20.1\"))\n.\nSent 1 packets.\n\nIn fact, we can do some other cool things with these send functions. If we had an array of packets (such as one created with Python loops and some random or incrementing values for IP address/TCP port), the send function would send each packet in that array:\n&gt;&gt;&gt; pkts\n&lt;Sniffed: TCP:0 UDP:5 ICMP:4 Other:1&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; send(pkts)\n..........\nSent 10 packets.\n\nThe send commands have some arguments to control the packet sending, here's the main ones you might consider using:\nsend(pkts, inter=0, loop=0)\nsendp(pkts, inter=0, loop=0)\n\niface: The interface to send the packets out from.\ninter: Time in seconds to wait between 2 packets.\nloop: Send the packets endlessly if not 0.\npkts: Can be a packet, an implicit packet or a list of them.\n\n","id":"https://thepacketgeek.com/scapy/building-network-tools/part-05/","title":"Scapy p.05"},"https://thepacketgeek.com/scapy/building-network-tools/part-06/":{"body":"We've sniffed some packets, dig down into packet layers and fields, and even sent some packets. Great job! It's time to step up our game with Scapy and start really using some of the power Scapy contains. Please Note: this next example is for education and example only. Please be responsible on your network, especially at work!\nScapy Send/Receive Function\nLet's get familiar with the sr(), sr1(), srp(), and srp1() functions. Just like the send(), function, the p at the end of the function name means that we're sending at L2 instead of L3. The functions with a 1 in them mean that Scapy will send the specified packet and end after receiving 1 answer/response instead of continuing to listen for answers/responses. I'll reference both functions as sr(), but the examples will use the correct function.\nSending an ICMP Echo Request (ping)\nThe sr() function is used to send a packet or group of packets when you expect a response back. We'll be sending an ICMP Echo Request (ping) since we can expect some sort of a response back from that. First let's use the sniff() function to figure out what an ICMP Echo Request looks like in Scapy:\n&gt;&gt;&gt; p = sniff(count=10,filter=\"icmp and ip host 4.2.2.1\")\n&gt;&gt;&gt; p\n&lt;Sniffed: TCP:0 UDP:0 ICMP:10 Other:0&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; p[0]\n&lt;Ether  dst=00:07:7d:6d:b4:9e src=b8:f6:b1:11:65:35 type=0x800 |&lt;IP  version=4L ihl=5L tos=0x0 len=84 id=14488 flags= frag=0L ttl=64 proto=icmp chksum=0x7bd6 src=172.16.20.40 dst=4.2.2.1 options=[] |&lt;ICMP  type=echo-request code=0 chksum=0xaba6 id=0x55d3 seq=0x0 |&lt;Raw |&gt;&gt;\n\nIn the previous ARP example we changed the dst and src MAC address, but since we're expecting a response back from another network device we'll have to leave it up to Scapy to fill those in when it sends the packets. Since we're building a L3 packet, we can actually leave off the Ether layer since Scapy will handle the generation of that. So let's start building the IP and ICMP layers. To see the available fields for each layer, and what the default values will be if we don't specify, use the ls('layer') command:\n&gt;&gt;&gt; ls(IP)\nversion    : BitField             = (4)\nihl        : BitField             = (None)\ntos        : XByteField           = (0)\nlen        : ShortField           = (None)\nid         : ShortField           = (1)\nflags      : FlagsField           = (0)\nfrag       : BitField             = (0)\nttl        : ByteField            = (64)\nproto      : ByteEnumField        = (0)\nchksum     : XShortField          = (None)\nsrc        : Emph                 = (None)\ndst        : Emph                 = ('127.0.0.1')\noptions    : PacketListField      = ([])\n&gt;&gt;&gt; ls(ICMP)\ntype       : ByteEnumField        = (8)\ncode       : MultiEnumField       = (0)\nchksum     : XShortField          = (None)\nid         : ConditionalField     = (0)\nseq        : ConditionalField     = (0)\nts_ori     : ConditionalField     = (13940582)\nts_rx      : ConditionalField     = (13940582)\nts_tx      : ConditionalField     = (13940582)\ngw         : ConditionalField     = ('0.0.0.0')\nptr        : ConditionalField     = (0)\nreserved   : ConditionalField     = (0)\naddr_mask  : ConditionalField     = ('0.0.0.0')\nunused     : ConditionalField     = (0)\n\nMost of those default values are fine, and src addresses will be filled out automatically by Scapy when it sends the packets. We can spoof those if desired, but again, since we're expecting a response we need to leave those alone. We'll be sending a L3 packet and we only expect one response, so we'll build and send our ICMP packet using the sr1() function:\n&gt;&gt;&gt; pingr = IP(dst=\"192.168.200.254\")/ICMP()\n&gt;&gt;&gt; sr1(pingr)\nBegin emission:\n..Finished to send 1 packets.\n.*\nReceived 84 packets, got 1 answers, remaining 0 packets\n&lt;IP  version=4L ihl=5L tos=0x0 len=28 id=1 flags= frag=0L ttl=255 proto=icmp chksum=0xa7c4 src=4.2.2.1 dst=172.16.20.40 options=[] |&lt;ICMP  type=echo-reply code=0 chksum=0xffff id=0x0 seq=0x0 |&lt;Padding |&gt;&gt;&gt;\n\n\nScapy prints out the response packet\n\nThe Received 84 packets is referring to the number of non-response packets Scapy sniffed while waiting for the response. It's not anything to be alarmed about, but just note that on a busy host you might see a big number of packets there. We can also define the ICMP packet directly in the sr1() function like this:\n&gt;&gt;&gt; sr1(IP(dst=\"192.168.200.254\")/ICMP())\nBegin emission:\n..Finished to send 1 packets.\n.*\nReceived 97 packets, got 1 answers, remaining 0 packets\n&lt;IP  version=4L ihl=5L tos=0x0 len=28 id=1 flags= frag=0L ttl=255 proto=icmp chksum=0xa7c4 src=4.2.2.1 dst=172.16.20.40 options=[] |&lt;ICMP  type=echo-reply code=0 chksum=0xffff id=0x0 seq=0x0 |&lt;Padding |&gt;&gt;&gt;\n\nWe can save the response packet into a variable just like we do when creating a packet:\n&gt;&gt;&gt; resp = sr1(pingr)\nBegin emission:\n..Finished to send 1 packets.\n.*\nReceived 147 packets, got 1 answers, remaining 0 packets\n&gt;&gt;&gt; resp[0].summary()\n'IP / ICMP 4.2.2.1 &gt; 172.16.20.40 echo-reply 0 / Padding'\n\n\nIf we're saving the response, Scapy won't print it out by default\n\nTwo other Scapy functions related to sending and receiving packets are the srloop() and srploop(). The srloop() will send the L3 packet and continue to resend the packet after each response is received. The srploop() does the same thing except for... you guessed it, L2 packets! This let's us simulate the ping command, and with the count argument, we can also define the number of times to loop:\n&gt;&gt;&gt; resp = srloop(pingr, count=5)\nRECV 1: IP / ICMP 4.2.2.1 &gt; 172.16.20.10 echo-reply 0 / Padding\nRECV 1: IP / ICMP 4.2.2.1 &gt; 172.16.20.10 echo-reply 0 / Padding\nRECV 1: IP / ICMP 4.2.2.1 &gt; 172.16.20.10 echo-reply 0 / Padding\nRECV 1: IP / ICMP 4.2.2.1 &gt; 172.16.20.10 echo-reply 0 / Padding\nRECV 1: IP / ICMP 4.2.2.1 &gt; 172.16.20.10 echo-reply 0 / Padding\n\nSent 5 packets, received 5 packets. 100.0% hits.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; resp\n(&lt;Results: TCP:0 UDP:0 ICMP:5 Other:0&gt;, &lt;PacketList: TCP:0 UDP:0 ICMP:0 Other:0&gt;)\n\n\nSaving the responses puts our packets into an array\n\nAs you can see, our Scapy skills are building and you might already have some ideas about how you can use these functions in your own network tools. In the next article, we'll see how you can build an ARP monitor to keep an ear on the network for possible spoofed ARP replies.\n","id":"https://thepacketgeek.com/scapy/building-network-tools/part-06/","title":"Scapy p.06"},"https://thepacketgeek.com/scapy/building-network-tools/part-07/":{"body":"Using Scapy in a Python Script\nSo far we've been working with Scapy in interactive mode. It's very powerful but there are times when it would be easier to work with a Python script instead. In order to use Scapy, we have to import the Scapy module like this:\nfrom scapy.all import *\n\nThis will import all Scapy functions, but if you know that you will only need a few of the functions, you can import them individually as well like this:\nfrom scapy.all import sr1,IP,ICMP\n\n\nThe biggest different with running Scapy in a script is that the output may not be as verbose as interactive mode. If you're not getting all the output you need, make sure to try using the \nprint command. Here's an example with our previous ping example:\n#! /usr/bin/env python3\n\nfrom scapy.all import ICMP, sr1\n\nprint(sr1(IP(dst=\"4.2.2.1\")/ICMP()).summary())\n\nConsole Output:\nBegin emission:\n..Finished to send 1 packets.\n.*\nReceived 4 packets, got 1 answers, remaining 0 packets\nIP / ICMP 4.2.2.1 &gt; 172.16.20.40 echo-reply 0 / Padding\n\nUsing Scapy to monitor ARP traffic\nLet's pretend that there is concern about someone potentially trying to use an ARP poisoning attack on our network. Using Scapy, we want to write a script that will listen to packets and print out all ARP requests and responses. We can do that very simply using the Scapy sniff() function and the filter argument like this:\n#! /usr/bin/env python3\n\nfrom scapy.all import sniff\n\npkts = sniff(filter=\"arp\", count=10)\nprint(pkts.summary())\n\nConsole Output:\nEther / ARP who has 172.16.20.10 says 172.16.20.40 / Padding\nEther / ARP who has 172.16.20.92 says 172.16.20.2 / Padding\nEther / ARP who has 172.16.20.2 says 172.16.20.92 / Padding\nEther / ARP who has 172.16.20.203 says 172.16.20.200 / Padding\nEther / ARP is at 00:11:22:29:a6:85 says 172.16.20.203\nEther / ARP who has 172.16.20.2 says 172.16.20.103 / Padding\nEther / ARP who has 172.16.20.103 says 172.16.20.2 / Padding\nEther / ARP who has 172.16.20.150 says 172.16.20.15 / Padding\nEther / ARP who has 172.16.20.2 says 172.16.20.19 / Padding\nEther / ARP who has 172.16.20.19 says 172.16.20.2 / Padding\n\nThis is a very simple script that gives us some good visibility to what's happening with ARP on our network. But what if we wanted to customize the output a little bit? Maybe we can get it in a format that would be easy to write to a file or send to some type of external monitoring server.\nUsing the prn Argument to Customize sniff() Output\nI'm going to introduce the prn argument and show you how to do change what Scapy prints out for each packet:\n#! /usr/bin/env python3\n\nfrom scapy.all import ARP, sniff\n\ndef arp_display(pkt):\n    if pkt[ARP].op == 1:  # who-has (request)\n        return f\"Request: {pkt[ARP].psrc} is asking about {pkt[ARP].pdst}\"\n    if pkt[ARP].op == 2:  # is-at (response)\n        return f\"*Response: {pkt[ARP].hwsrc} has address {pkt[ARP].psrc}\"\n\nsniff(prn=arp_display, filter=\"arp\", store=0, count=10)\n\nConsole Output:\nRequest: 172.16.20.168 is asking about 172.16.20.85\nRequest: 172.16.20.168 is asking about 172.16.20.229\nRequest: 172.16.20.2 is asking about 172.16.20.203\n*Response: aa:bb:cc:29:a6:85 has address 172.16.20.203\nRequest: 172.16.20.200 is asking about 172.16.20.82\nRequest: 172.16.20.51 is asking about 172.16.20.254\nRequest: 172.16.20.15 is asking about 172.16.20.58\nRequest: 172.16.20.15 is asking about 172.16.20.58\nRequest: 172.16.20.200 is asking about 172.16.20.44\n*Response: dd:ee:ff:a2:02:bf has address 172.16.20.44\n\nBasically, what the prn argument lets us do is replace the default Scapy printout of the packet summary and run our own function to determine how Scapy prints out. That's really cool! It works by passing the packet object to the defined function, in this case arp_display(), each time a packet is sniffed that matches the specified filter.\nWe can do a lot more with that prn argument and passing more than just the packet object to the custom defined function using nested functions. That's outside the scope of this guide but feel free to read about it here: Scapy Sniffing with Custom Actions\n","id":"https://thepacketgeek.com/scapy/building-network-tools/part-07/","title":"Scapy p.07"},"https://thepacketgeek.com/scapy/building-network-tools/part-08/":{"body":"We've doing a lot of packet sniffing, analysis, and even some basic packet crafting of our own. With the ICMP packets we created, we only set the destination we wanted to use and let Scapy take care of the rest.\nTaking Control of Protocol Fields\nI want to show you how to take a bit more control over the packet creation process by creating a TCP Christmas Tree packet. I'll let you read the details, just know that the name of this packet comes from every TCP header flag bit turned on (set to 1), so it can be said the packet is \"lit up like a Christmas Tree.\" Here's how we can build this with Scapy:\n#! /usr/bin/env python3\n\nfrom random import randint\nfrom scapy.all import IP, TCP, send\n\n# Create the skeleton of our packet\ntemplate = IP(dst=\"172.16.20.10\")/TCP()\n\n# Start lighting up those bits!\ntemplate[TCP].flags = 'UFP'\n\n# Create a list with a large number of packets to send\n# Each packet will have a random TCP dest port for attack obfuscation\nxmas = []\nfor pktNum in range(0,100):\n  xmas.extend(template)\n  xmas[pktNum][TCP].dport = randint(1,65535)\n\n# Send the list of packets\nsend(xmas)\n\nConsole Output:\n....................................................................................................\nSent 100 packets.\n\nAlthough we don't get much output from the send() function, and no option for the prn argument, we can sniff and see what happened:\n\n\nWireshark sniff showing several xmas tree packets and the TCP header with our bits set\n\nWoohoo! Look how awesome we are! Make sure to look through that script so you can see what we're doing. We want to send random TCP ports in our packet, so we have to make an array of packets, each with a different TCP destination port. You could also randomize the source port or any other field using the technique I did in that script.\n","id":"https://thepacketgeek.com/scapy/building-network-tools/part-08/","title":"Scapy p.08"},"https://thepacketgeek.com/scapy/building-network-tools/part-09/":{"body":"We've been able to work with Ethernet, ARP, IP, ICMP, and TCP pretty easily so far thanks to Scapy's built in protocol support. Next on our list of protocols to work with are UDP and DNS.\nDNS Request and Response\nUsing the sr1() function, we can craft a DNS request and capture the returned DNS response. Since DNS runs over IP and UDP, we will need to use those in our packet:\n#! /usr/bin/env python3\n\nfrom scapy.all import DNS, DNSQR, IP, sr1, UDP\n\ndns_req = IP(dst='8.8.8.8')/\n    UDP(dport=53)/\n    DNS(rd=1, qd=DNSQR(qname='www.thepacketgeek.com'))\nanswer = sr1(dns_req, verbose=0)\n\nprint(answer[DNS].summary())\n\nConsole Output:\nBegin emission:\n..Finished to send 1 packets.\n..*\nReceived 5 packets, got 1 answers, remaining 0 packets\nDNS Ans \"198.71.55.197\"\n\n\nThe DNS layer summary is printed showing the IP address of the hostname requested\n\nWithout too much work we were able to write a short script to query some DNS name to IP address resolutions. Just think about what this means; we could read in a list of hostnames to resolve and send the IP addresses off to some function to do some more tests such as ping or TCP scans.\nDNS Forwarding and Spoofing\nOk, so sending a DNS query was fun, but let's build on that. How about hand building a DNS service that can handle DNS forwarding, but with the added functionality of handing out a custom IP address for a certain domain name. This is similar to how the DNS server part of the PlexConnect utility works to hijack some communications from the AppleTV. This is going to jump up in complexity quite a bit from our previous example but the process is still pretty simple:\n\nSniff with Scapy to listen for incoming DNS requests \n\nFiltering for UDP port 53 destined to the server's IP address\n\n\nIf the request is for our special domain name, send a spoofed DNS response \n\nSwap source/dest UDP ports and IP addresses\nMatch DNS request ID\n\n\nOtherwise, make a new DNS request and send the response back to the requesting host \n\nMake a new request, and save the DNS Response\nSend a response back to the client matching the same fields as above\n\n\n\nWe're doing a lot of field replacements, especially on the handcrafted spoof response.

We will be emulating some nmap &amp; Angry IP Scanner type features and creating the following tools:\n\nTCP Port Range Scanner\nICMP Ping Sweep\nCombining the Two\n\nTCP Port Range Scanner\nThis is a fairly basic tool to test whether a host has specific TCP ports open and listening. We start out by defining our host and ports to scan and then move on to the fun stuff. Using a random TCP source port to help obfuscate the attack (although most firewalls are smarter than this nowadays), we send a TCP SYN packet to each destination TCP port specified. If we get no response or a TCP RST in return, we know that the host is filtering or not listening on that port. If we get an ICMP unreachable or error response, we also know the host is not willing to take requests on that port. But, if we get an expected TCP SYN/ACK response, we will send a RST so the host doesn't keep listening for our ACK since we already know the host is listening on that port. Here's the code:\n#! /usr/bin/env python3\n\nimport random\nfrom scapy.all import ICMP, IP, sr1, TCP\n\n# Define end host and TCP port range\nhost = \"192.168.40.1\"\nport_range = [22, 23, 80, 443, 3389]\n\n# Send SYN with random Src Port for each Dst port\nfor dst_port in port_range:\n    src_port = random.randint(1025,65534)\n    resp = sr1(\n        IP(dst=host)/TCP(sport=src_port,dport=dst_port,flags=\"S\"),timeout=1,\n        verbose=0,\n    )\n\n    if resp is None:\n        print(f\"{host}:{dst_port} is filtered (silently dropped).\")\n\n    elif(resp.haslayer(TCP)):\n        if(resp.getlayer(TCP).flags == 0x12):\n            # Send a gratuitous RST to close the connection\n            send_rst = sr(\n                IP(dst=host)/TCP(sport=src_port,dport=dst_port,flags='R'),\n                timeout=1,\n                verbose=0,\n            )\n            print(f\"{host}:{dst_port} is open.\")\n\n        elif (resp.getlayer(TCP).flags == 0x14):\n            print(f\"{host}:{dst_port} is closed.\")\n\n    elif(resp.haslayer(ICMP)):\n        if(\n            int(resp.getlayer(ICMP).type) == 3 and\n            int(resp.getlayer(ICMP).code) in [1,2,3,9,10,13]\n        ):\n            print(f\"{host}:{dst_port} is filtered (silently dropped).\")\n\nConsole Output:\n172.16.20.40:22 is filtered (silently dropped).\n172.16.20.40:23 is filtered (silently dropped).\n172.16.20.40:80 is open.\n172.16.20.40:443 is open.\n172.16.20.40:449 is filtered (silently dropped).\n\n\nFor more information on TCP behavior and how this was created, visit: Port Scanning Using Scapy\n\nICMP Ping Sweep\nThis script is an extension of our ICMP ping utility from the Sending and Receiving example. We will use a network given with a CIDR mask to specify the hosts to run the ping scan on. Then, using a Python for loop we iterate through each address and try pinging. If the response times out or returns an ICMP error (such as unreachable or admin deny), we know that the host is not up or is blocking ICMP. Otherwise, if we receive a response we know that host is online. Check out the code here:\n#! /usr/bin/env python3\n\nfrom ipaddress import IPv4Network\nimport random\nfrom scapy.all import ICMP, IP, sr1, TCP\n\n# Define IP range to ping\nnetwork = \"192.168.40.0/24\"\n\n# make list of addresses out of network, set live host counter\naddresses = IPv4Network(network)\nlive_count = 0\n\n# Send ICMP ping request, wait for answer\nfor host in addresses:\n    if (host in (addresses.network_address, addresses.broadcast_address)):\n        # Skip network and broadcast addresses\n        continue\n\n    resp = sr1(\n        IP(dst=str(host))/ICMP(),\n        timeout=2,\n        verbose=0,\n    )\n\n    if resp is None:\n        print(f\"{host} is down or not responding.\")\n    elif (\n        int(resp.getlayer(ICMP).type)==3 and\n        int(resp.getlayer(ICMP).code) in [1,2,3,9,10,13]\n    ):\n        print(f\"{host} is blocking ICMP.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"{host} is responding.\")\n        live_count += 1\n\nprint(f\"{live_count}/{addresses.num_addresses} hosts are online.\")\n\nConsole Output:\n172.16.20.1 is responding.\nWARNING: Mac address to reach destination not found.

(truncated)\n19/254 hosts are online.\n\nNOTE: This could certainly be made much faster with threading since this is mostly IO bound (waiting for network responses), however that is outside the scope of this article.\nIn this example, the WARNING: Mac address to reach destination not found. Using broadcast. is telling us that Scapy doesn't know the destination ARP address to send the packet to. This is only showing up because I am running this test on my locally connected network. If I were running this scan on a different network, Scapy would use the gateway MAC address for the L2 destination.\nCombining the Two\nThose first two tools are cool, but you know what would be cooler? Combining them! With a new tool that combines those two features, we can scan a subnet for online hosts and then also run a TCP scan on the online hosts.\nTo get this new tool up and running, we can pretty much use the existing code with just a couple changes. We can get rid of the single host variable since we'll be using the network statment (this can define a single host using the /32 CIDR mask). Also, to keep the code clean and easy to understand we should move our TCP scan to it's own function so we can call that on any hosts that respond to the ICMP ping request.

The intended purpose of this function is to control how the packet prints out in the console allowing you to replace the default packet printing display with a format of your choice.\nThe prn argument is defined as:\n\nprn: function to apply to each packet. If something is returned, it is displayed. For instance you can use prn = lambda x: x.summary().\n\n\nIn order for your program/script to format and return the packet info as you wish, the sniff function passes the packet object as the one and only argument into the function you specify in the sniff's prn argument. This gives us the option to do some fun stuff (not just formatting) with each packet sniffed 🙂\nFor example, we can now perform custom actions with each sniffed packet. This can be anything from incrementing a packet count somewhere in the program, to doing some advanced packet parsing or manipulation, or even shipping that packet off into some sort of storage (.pcap appending or API POSTing anyone??).\nHere's a simple example for keeping track of the number of packets sniffed\nThis script keeps a Counter with an A/Z pair of IP addresses, displays the total packet count with each packet print(), and then prints out the conversation counts at the end.\n#! /usr/bin/env python3\n\nfrom collections import Counter\nfrom scapy.all import sniff\n\n## Create a Packet Counter\npacket_counts = Counter()\n\n## Define our Custom Action function\ndef custom_action(packet):\n    # Create tuple of Src/Dst in sorted order\n    key = tuple(sorted([packet[0][1].src, packet[0][1].dst]))\n    packet_counts.update([key])\n    return f\"Packet #{sum(packet_counts.values())}: {packet[0][1].src} ==&gt; {packet[0][1].dst}\"\n\n## Setup sniff, filtering for IP traffic\nsniff(filter=\"ip\", prn=custom_action, count=10)\n\n## Print out packet count per A &lt;--&gt; Z address pair\nprint(\"\\n\".join(f\"{f'{key[0]} &lt;--&gt; {key[1]}'}: {count}\" for key, count in packet_counts.items()))\n\nConsole Output:\nPacket #1: 172.16.200.88 ==&gt; 255.255.255.255\nPacket #2: 172.16.200.88 ==&gt; 172.16.98.255\nPacket #3: 172.16.200.88 ==&gt; 255.255.255.255\nPacket #4: 172.16.200.88 ==&gt; 255.255.255.255\nPacket #5: 172.16.72.72 ==&gt; 172.16.98.203\nPacket #6: 172.16.98.203 ==&gt; 172.16.72.72\nPacket #7: 172.16.98.203 ==&gt; 172.16.72.72\nPacket #8: 172.16.72.72 ==&gt; 172.16.98.203\nPacket #9: 172.16.72.72 ==&gt; 172.16.98.203\nPacket #10: 172.16.98.203 ==&gt; 172.16.72.72\n172.16.200.88 &lt;--&gt; 255.255.255.255: 3\n172.16.200.88 &lt;--&gt; 172.16.98.255: 1\n172.16.72.72 &lt;--&gt; 172.16.98.203: 6\n\nCustom Formatted ARP Monitor\nHere I use the same prn function and some conditional statements to very clearly tell me what ARP traffic my computer is seeing.\n#! /usr/bin/env python3\n\nfrom collections import Counter\nfrom scapy.all import ARP, sniff\n\ndef arp_display(pkt):\n    if pkt[ARP].op == 1: #who-has (request)\n        return f\"Request: {pkt[ARP].psrc} is asking about {pkt[ARP].pdst}\"\n    if pkt[ARP].op == 2: #is-at (response)\n        return f\"*Response: {pkt[ARP].hwsrc} has address {pkt[ARP].psrc}\"\n\nsniff(prn=arp_display, filter=\"arp\", store=0, count=10)\n\nConsole Output:\nRequest: 172.16.20.168 is asking about 172.16.20.85\nRequest: 172.16.20.168 is asking about 172.16.20.229\nRequest: 172.16.20.2 is asking about 172.16.20.203\n*Response: aa:bb:cc:29:a6:85 has address 172.16.20.203\nRequest: 172.16.20.200 is asking about 172.16.20.82\nRequest: 172.16.20.51 is asking about 172.16.20.254\nRequest: 172.16.20.15 is asking about 172.16.20.58\nRequest: 172.16.20.15 is asking about 172.16.20.58\nRequest: 172.16.20.200 is asking about 172.16.20.44\n*Response: dd:ee:ff:a2:02:bf has address 172.16.20.44\n\nAn important thing to keep in mind when using the prn argument\nIn the case of the example above, you are passing the custom_action function into the sniff function. If you used sniff(prn=custom_action()) instead, you would be passing the function's returned value to the sniff function. This will generate the returned text before the function has a packet to parse and will not give you the results you want.\nIf you want to pass parameters into the custom_action function for additional control or the ability to modularize out the customAction function, you will have to use a nested function. I cover how to do that in the next article.\n","id":"https://thepacketgeek.com/scapy/sniffing-custom-actions/part-1/","title":"Scapy Sniffing with Custom Actions"},"https://thepacketgeek.com/scapy/sniffing-custom-actions/part-2/":{"body":"In the previous article I demonstrated how to add a custom function to change the formatting of the packet output in the console or do some sort of custom action with each packet. That example passed the function (a Callable) without any additional args. When the prn passed function is called (with each packet), it receives a single argument of the packet that was just sniffed.\nUsing nested functions to harness the power of closure, you can bind any number of arguments to the function that is executed on each packet by Scapy. In order to bind additional arguments to the prn function, we have to use nested functions (similar to a decorator). Check out this example, created to upload the scapy packet info to an API via the Python Requests module:\n#! /usr/bin/env python3\n\nimport json\nimport requests\nfrom collections import Counter\nfrom scapy.all import sniff\n\n# define API options\nurl = \"http://hosted.app/api/packets\"\ntoken = \"supersecretusertoken\"\n\n# create parent function with passed in arguments\ndef custom_action(url: str, token: str):\n\n  # uploadPacket function has access to the url &amp; token parameters\n  # because they are 'closed' in the nested function\n  def upload_packet(packet):\n    # upload packet, using passed arguments\n    headers = {'content-type': 'application/json'}\n    data = {\n        'packet': packet.summary(),\n        'token': token,\n    }\n    r = requests.post(url, data=data, headers=headers)\n\n  return upload_packet\n\nsniff(prn=custom_action(url, token))\n\nThis may seem a little strange, but here's an order-of-events explanation for what's happening:\n\nWe define our url &amp; token variables, just like in the first example.\nWe define the custom_action function. This will be run when the scapy sniff function first runs to get the value info for the prn argument. Note the two parameters that we pass into custom_action.\nInside custom_action, we create another function that takes the scapy implicitly passed packet as a parameter. This is the function that will upload the packet info to our API.\nThe upload_packet function is nested in custom_action so it has access to the url &amp; token variables because it is inside the parent function's scope.\nThe return value of custom_action is the upload_packet function, so this function will be run along with every sniffed packet based on the prn argument. Even though the custom_action function is not executed to take in the url &amp; token parameters, they are locked into the nested upload_packet function due to Python's capacity for 'closure'.\nAfter we define the custom_action and nested upload_packet functions, we run the Scapy sniff function with the returned value of custom_action passed via the prn argument.\n\nUsing closures to 'lock-in' any number of arguments to the custom_action function gives us much more flexibility. I was able to modularize my custom_action.py file in order to clean up my Scapy sniffing script.\nHere's another example that achieves the same affect using functools.partial to close in the url &amp; token arguments:\n#! /usr/bin/env python3\n\nimport json\nimport requests\nfrom collections import Counter\nfrom functools import partial\nfrom scapy.all import sniff\n\n# define API options\nurl = \"http://hosted.app/api/packets\"\ntoken = \"supersecretusertoken\"\n\n\ndef upload_packet(api_endpoint: str, api_token: str, packet):\n    # upload packet, using passed arguments\n    headers = {'content-type': 'application/json'}\n    data = {\n        'packet': packet.summary(),\n        'token': api_token,\n    }\n    r = requests.post(api_endpoint, data=data, headers=headers)\n\nsniff(prn=partial(upload_packet, url, token))\n\n\nSee how I was able to move a big chunk of verbose packet protocol checking into a separate module by looking at my two python files in this project: Scapy-to-API\n","id":"https://thepacketgeek.com/scapy/sniffing-custom-actions/part-2/","title":"Scapy Sniffing with Custom Actions"},"https://thepacketgeek.com/scapy/writing-packets/":{"body":"This is a follow-up post to accompany the previous&nbsp;importing packets from trace files with scapy&nbsp;post.

There's no options or special functions, you probably should do your packet processing before you write the packets to file.\n","id":"https://thepacketgeek.com/scapy/writing-packets/","title":"Writing Packets to Trace File with Scapy"}},"docInfo":{"https://thepacketgeek.com/":{"body":0,"title":0},"https://thepacketgeek.com/exabgp/":{"body":0,"title":1},"https://thepacketgeek.com/exabgp/advanced-route-announcement/":{"body":739,"title":3},"https://thepacketgeek.com/exabgp/automate-exabgp/":{"body":435,"title":6},"https://thepacketgeek.com/exabgp/control-bgp-advertisements/":{"body":560,"title":3},"https://thepacketgeek.com/exabgp/getting-started/":{"body":685,"title":2},"https://thepacketgeek.com/exabgp/http-api/":{"body":490,"title":4},"https://thepacketgeek.com/exabgp/storing-in-mongo-db/":{"body":734,"title":5},"https://thepacketgeek.com/pyshark/":{"body":0,"title":1},"https://thepacketgeek.com/pyshark/capture-modules/":{"body":462,"title":3},"https://thepacketgeek.com/pyshark/capture-object/":{"body":131,"title":3},"https://thepacketgeek.com/pyshark/intro-to-pyshark/":{"body":282,"title":2},"https://thepacketgeek.com/pyshark/packet-object/":{"body":580,"title":3},"https://thepacketgeek.com/rust/":{"body":0,"title":1},"https://thepacketgeek.com/rust/hide-cargo-lock-diff/":{"body":282,"title":4},"https://thepacketgeek.com/rust/macros/":{"body":0,"title":3},"https://thepacketgeek.com/rust/macros/improved-retry-macro-setup/":{"body":354,"title":5},"https://thepacketgeek.com/rust/macros/intro/":{"body":765,"title":3},"https://thepacketgeek.com/rust/macros/macro-matching-and-nesting/":{"body":871,"title":5},"https://thepacketgeek.com/rust/tcpstream/":{"body":0,"title":3},"https://thepacketgeek.com/rust/tcpstream/create-a-protocol/":{"body":825,"title":3},"https://thepacketgeek.com/rust/tcpstream/lines-codec/":{"body":474,"title":2},"https://thepacketgeek.com/rust/tcpstream/reading-and-writing/":{"body":642,"title":3},"https://thepacketgeek.com/scapy/":{"body":0,"title":1},"https://thepacketgeek.com/scapy/building-network-tools/":{"body":0,"title":4},"https://thepacketgeek.com/scapy/building-network-tools/part-01/":{"body":167,"title":2},"https://thepacketgeek.com/scapy/building-network-tools/part-02/":{"body":315,"title":2},"https://thepacketgeek.com/scapy/building-network-tools/part-03/":{"body":619,"title":2},"https://thepacketgeek.com/scapy/building-network-tools/part-04/":{"body":751,"title":2},"https://thepacketgeek.com/scapy/building-network-tools/part-05/":{"body":533,"title":2},"https://thepacketgeek.com/scapy/building-network-tools/part-06/":{"body":632,"title":2},"https://thepacketgeek.com/scapy/building-network-tools/part-07/":{"body":365,"title":2},"https://thepacketgeek.com/scapy/building-network-tools/part-08/":{"body":168,"title":2},"https://thepacketgeek.com/scapy/building-network-tools/part-09/":{"body":498,"title":2},"https://thepacketgeek.com/scapy/building-network-tools/part-10/":{"body":808,"title":2},"https://thepacketgeek.com/scapy/building-network-tools/part-11/":{"body":69,"title":2},"https://thepacketgeek.com/scapy/importing-pcaps/":{"body":427,"title":5},"https://thepacketgeek.com/scapy/sniffing-custom-actions/":{"body":0,"title":4},"https://thepacketgeek.com/scapy/sniffing-custom-actions/part-1/":{"body":410,"title":4},"https://thepacketgeek.com/scapy/sniffing-custom-actions/part-2/":{"body":344,"title":4},"https://thepacketgeek.com/scapy/writing-packets/":{"body":57,"title":5}},"length":41},"lang":"English"};
